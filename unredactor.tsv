cegme	training	ashton kutcher	I couldn't image ██████████████ in a serious role, but his performance truly
SarahBrown	training	Ashton Kutcher	I'll admit that I was reluctant to see it because from what I knew of ██████████████ he was only able to do comedy.
SarahBrown	training	Noonan	The acting is all up to ██████ and he carries his thankless character perfectly.
SarahBrown	training	Picasso	███████ was a finer draftsman and a brilliant artist at that age than many artists will ever become in a lifetime.
SarahBrown	training	Tom Noonan	The incredible performance by ██████████ is brilliant and provocative and the editing, sound design, cinematography and directing are truly inspired.
SarahBrown	training	Shabana Azmi	 Her Excellency Madam ████████████ has worked in countless movies over life time.
SarahBrown	training	Mehta	These two genres (i.e. deep meaningful alternative-love story and comic satire) usually mix together just as well as oil and water do, but █████ (somehow) manages to achieve the balance to near perfection.
SarahBrown	training	Mehta	While developing her primary subject matter, █████ manages to achieve this secondary theme skillfully.
SarahBrown	training	Ram	As legend goes, ███ subjugates his wife by making her walk through a Fire to prove her `purity.'
SarahBrown	training	Sita	████, in response, cries and leaves him, reuniting with her mother(the Earth).
SarahBrown	training	Ms Mehta	I guess the fact that so many women applauded ████████'s work, was because it provided them with an option to think for themselves.
SarahBrown	training	Ms Mehta	Bravo to ████████ in translating her vision so clearly.
SarahBrown	training	Radha	I especially like the flashbacks to the young █████ trying to 'see' for the ocean.
SarahBrown	training	A.R. Rahman	The movie is beautifully filmed and enhanced by the musical score by ███████████.
SarahBrown	training	Ashton Kutcher	██████████████ can act!
SarahBrown	training	Deepa Mehta's	"█████████████ ""Fire"" is groundbreaking, bold, and artistic."
SarahBrown	training	A.R. Rahman's	█████████████ music is the work of the genius and almost plays the role of another character in the film.
SarahBrown	training	Deepa Mehta	'Water' (2005), the final part of Toronto-based Indian film-director ███████████'s elemental trilogy has been finally completed, almost ten years after the release of the very first controversial element, 'Fire' (1996), which was followed with a slightly lesser controversial sequel '1947: Earth' (1998).
SarahBrown	training	Deepa Mehta	International fame followed ███████████ in 1996 with the release of the controversial 'Fire', which spread with rage among the false patriotic consciousness existing Indian extremist.
SarahBrown	training	Camilla	Having already explored friendship between two women in '███████', in 'Fire' Mehta went a step further to portray a more intimate relationship between two lonely neglected women.
SarahBrown	training	Kulbhushan Kharbanda	Set in modern day India, the suburbs of the capital city of New Delhi, it shows two brothers and their wives, the elder brother (████████████████████) having joined a weird Hindu sect leads a life of celibacy, faithful to his guru of sexless existence.
SarahBrown	training	Deepa Mehta's	 Two years later, █████████████ second installment was the element of mother earth, released in India by the name of '1947: Earth',yet another excellent movie by a great director, this time in the Hindi language, unlike 'Fire', which was made in the English language.
SarahBrown	training	Deepa Mehta	 Now ███████████ has managed to complete the trilogy, despite a lot of problems, having released the final installment recently, 'Water'.
SarahBrown	training	Nandita Das	The scene where ███████████ loses her virginity to her husband certainly was the first of its kind in Indian cinemas.
SarahBrown	training	Nandita Das	Good acting by all the actors especially ███████████ amidst criticism from the Indian public
SarahBrown	training	Deepa Mehta	I admire ███████████ and this movie is a masterpiece.
SarahBrown	training	Sita	████ still cared enough for him to find that moment to let him know that he is not responsible for her deviant outlet to her blocked desires.
SarahBrown	training	Sita	 But the final act of rejection was by the grandmother - she could not break free from her rusted mindset to accept ████'s desire.
SarahBrown	training	Mehta	"I finally watched the third film in █████'s trilogy: ""Fire""."
SarahBrown	training	Mehta	 █████ is one brave lady: she sees with a clear eye much that is jaundiced, false and repressive about the great society from which she came from.
SarahBrown	training	Mehta	Worse, if someone like █████ has the courage to hold up a mirror to these issues, she faces death threats.
SarahBrown	training	Mehta	█████ is clearly impatient with the totally rigid religious attitudes that either keep widows in misery (Water) or else keep women enslaved to loveless marriages (Fire).
SarahBrown	training	Mehta	In any case █████'s film is a very moving, powerful attempt at sexual discourse that holds modern Indian relationships up to probing scrutiny.
SarahBrown	training	Mehta	█████ is forcing the issues to be looked at no matter how much flack.
SarahBrown	training	Superb	██████, disturbing, provocative, taboo shattering.
SarahBrown	training	Kevin Costner	The trailers looked good, but the water theme was giving me bad flashbacks to the last █████████████ movie that dealt with the subject - Waterworld.
SarahBrown	training	Ashton Kutcher	Plus, despite the promise ██████████████ showed in The Butterfly Effect, I'm still not completely sold on him.
SarahBrown	training	Kenny Rogers'	The movie immediately throws us into the midst of a tense rescue mission, and I was gripped tighter than █████████████ orange face lift.
SarahBrown	training	George Clooney	Sunglasses, a tough guy toothpick in his mouth, and sportin' a smirk that'd make ██████████████ proud?
SarahBrown	training	Costner	I had a bad feeling that the pace would slow too much when ███████ started training the young guys, but on the contrary, the training sessions just might be the most interesting aspect of the film.
SarahBrown	training	Deepa Mehta's	█████████████ somewhat mis-titled FIRE is the first of a loosely connected trilogy, here linked by the theme of the elements, and more symbolic than consuming.
SarahBrown	training	Sita	One husband married a vivacious young woman, ████, out of family obligation.
SarahBrown	training	Sita	This arranged marriage is uncomfortable for them both but in the beginning ████ makes an attempt to connect with her sullen husband.
SarahBrown	training	Sita	However, he sees himself as a victim and could have cared less about ████--and he continues to have an affair with a liberal-minded Chinese lady.
SarahBrown	training	Sita	In their dead marriage, sex was purely meant to produce children and there was no way ████ could have any of her sexual or emotional needs met.
SarahBrown	training	Deepa Mehta	By the way, director ███████████ (a popular female director) has made several other wonderful films such as EARTH and BOLLYWOOD/Hollywood.
SarahBrown	training	Deepa Mehta	This is my first ███████████ film.
SarahBrown	training	Mehta	█████'s film of two bisexual ladies in an Indian middle-class household may be sacrilege to some, but merely captures the atrophy of middle-class homes that does not seem to aspire for something better than its immediate survival in a limited social space.
SarahBrown	training	Claudio Carvalho	Previous reviewer ████████████████ gave a much better recap of the film's plot details than I could.
SarahBrown	training	William Faulkner's	This intelligent, moving and beautiful film is a study in the ways people react to tradition (reminds me of ██████████████████ novels).
SarahBrown	training	Ashton	I am happy to say that ██████ is great in this part.
SarahBrown	validation	Ben Randall	"However, the use of humor, the exploration of the toughness of the training and the fun of watching ███████████ ""do his own thing as a trainer"", kept me riveted and thoroughly entertained."
SarahBrown	validation	Shabana Azmi	To my mind, the very character played by ████████████ is a symbol of the Indian feminine protest against the Indian society.
SarahBrown	validation	Nandita Das	I was impressed with ███████████, who was quite attractive, and played her character with total earnestness.
SarahBrown	validation	Shabana Azmi	But I was even more impressed with ████████████, who I understand is a long-time fixture of Bollywood.
SarahBrown	validation	Oldboy	"Besides the apparent connections with ""██████"" (and Park-wook's other films), an incestuous relation in this one really disturbed me, and also the subtle erotic theme that hung around all the vampiric, physical action."
SarahBrown	validation	Stanley Kubrick	Park-wook has really, really mastered his cinematography in this film, and owes a lot to ███████████████; there are a whole lot of beautiful shots strewn throughout the film, some for simple effects and some that require several glances and probably repeated views to fully catch.
SarahBrown	validation	Chan-wook Park's	████████████████ new film is a complex film that is not easy to classify.
SarahBrown	validation	Emile Zola's	"The film takes its own matters and mixes them with classic European literature, in this case ████████████ ""Thérèse Raquin""."
SarahBrown	validation	Chan-wook Park's	Although I've never seen the film, I couldn't help but feel like this was ████████████████ version of Twilight.
SarahBrown	validation	Park	The psychological aspect that I love about ████'s previous films is in Thirst, as well.
SarahBrown	validation	Chan-wook Park	██████████████ bites into the vampire mythology with Thirst and puts his own dark, psychological twist on it.
SarahBrown	validation	Park Chan-wook	Anything ██████████████ creates is guaranteed to be unique, brilliant, and very twisted at a minimum.
SarahBrown	validation	Park Chan-wook	As negative as it may sound the positives definitely outweigh the negatives and another volume has without a doubt been added to the dark and twisted Zeitgeist of ██████████████ film.
SarahBrown	validation	Bakjwi	That was not the case when I watched ██████, under the American title Thirst.
SarahBrown	validation	Bakjwi	 There aren't many negatives I can say about ██████.
SarahBrown	validation	Dracula	"""bakjwi"" literally means bat in korean and we all know that in many classic vampire stories, you see count ███████ or vampires turning into a bat and fly away or wuheva."
SarahBrown	validation	aesop	Duality of human nature = if you ever read █████'s fables, there is this one fable where mammals and birds are fighting and a bat just can't seem to take a side and it tries to play both sides to his advantage.
SarahBrown	validation	Chan-wook Park	██████████████ is a master of cinematography and this movie is no exception.
SarahBrown	validation	Chan-wook Park	██████████████ is no stranger to controversy as we know, and this film touches on taboo almost as much as oldboy.
SarahBrown	validation	Hyeon	Instead of legitimately dying, █████ becomes a vampire, always yearning for the sustenance blood gives for him to fight off an infectious disease which returns causing the symptoms which flat-lined him to begin with(..bumps/sores, and the body vomits blood).
SarahBrown	validation	Hyeon	Sunlight, as is known in the vampire genre, causes torturous death if exposed to █████ for a length of time.
SarahBrown	validation	Hyeon	In doing so, █████ has created a monster.
SarahBrown	validation	Park Chan-Wook	██████████████ throws that concept completely out the window and shows directly what he wants--and what he wants to show is pretty much anything he can think of.
SarahBrown	validation	Park	Leaving it to the actors and dialog to create subtlety, from a stylistic perspective ████ seems willing to do just about anything to get his point across.
SarahBrown	validation	Chan-Wook	█████████ adds some much needed humour into the film, but this is only realised in the final third of the movie.
SarahBrown	validation	Park Chun-wook's	'Thirst' is original, entertaining and fortunately a little less weird than ████████████████ earlier endeavors.
SarahBrown	validation	Chan-wook Park	██████████████, you have to hand it to the guy.
SarahBrown	validation	Clancy Brown	"Co-star ████████████ (HBO's ""Carnivale"" - great to see him again) played the captain of the Coast Guard's Kodiak, Alaska base in a strong, convincing role as a leader with the prerequisite and necessary ice water in his veins."
SarahBrown	validation	Sang	There's nothing terribly weepy or insipid with the story and characters at any point, and the implications put forth from religion early on (████, for example, is seen as a healer of sorts since he rose from the dead thanks to his vampirism, even as he just can't be that and knows it) on top of those about good vs evil, push it up into another plane cinematically.
SarahBrown	validation	Chan-wook Park	Korean cinema has the ability to turn genres on its head, and the latest by the celebrated director ██████████████ is a tale of a good pious priest who becomes a vampire.
SarahBrown	testing	Kevin Costner	The mentor this time is played perfectly by █████████████; An ordinary man with common everyday problems who lives an extraordinary conviction, to save lives.
SarahBrown	testing	Costner	While his scenes with the local love interest are a tad stiff and don't generate enough heat to melt butter, he compliments ███████ well.
SarahBrown	testing	Leonard Maltin	Well, I have to disagree with ██████████████ on this animated short.
SarahBrown	testing	Bob McKimson	Director ████████████ offers endless laughters by means of absurd and unexpected demonstrative humour.
SarahBrown	testing	Maria Von Trapp	"It will be the death of ███████████████"" Fascinating study on changing an image."
SarahBrown	testing	Julie	█████ is beautiful and uses her many talents, throughout the film.
SarahBrown	testing	Julie Andrews	Fun, entertaining movie about WWII German spy (█████████████!)
SarahBrown	testing	Rosie Perez	Had to do a double take when I saw that was ███████████ there.
SarahBrown	testing	Merkerson	But, overall a great film with a truly outstanding performance by █████████.
SarahBrown	testing	Ruben Santiago Hudson	Of course, none of this would have been possible if █████████████████████ hadn't written his wonderful play.
wboncal	training	Patrick Deware	'Gerard and the late ██████████████ are two bitch-slapping, hippy drifters with many sexual insecurities, going around molesting women and committing petty crimes.

wboncal	training	Eddie Murphy	A strange role for ████████████ to take at the height of his career.
wboncal	training	Olivia DeHavilland	An excellent period murder melodrama, with Fontaine effectively playing against her earlier naive wallflower type, in a role that reportedly ██████████████████ turned down.
wboncal	training	Sofia Loren	She is ███████████, who is the wife of brutish public servant and mother of six children.
wboncal	training	John Holmes	Just saying you've got a movie about ███████████ is a guarantee to get some folks in front of the screen, but writer/director James Cox delivers oh so much more.

wboncal	training	Show People	Prior to seeing ███████████, my impression of silent comedy was essentially slapstick, and slapstick only.
wboncal	training	Tim Krabbé	The great plot comes from the novel by ██████████, who also adapted this story for the screen.

wboncal	training	Leslie Nielsen	Some will probably see this film simply to catch a glimpse of young, good-looking ██████████████ in one of his first starring roles.

wboncal	training	Sean Young	By all reports, ██████████ proves a weird person, and she is scarcely beautiful.
wboncal	training	Jamie Foxx	I had no expectations; I'd never heard of ██████████; all I knew was that the film has some strong character actors in it.
wboncal	training	Jane Russell	The sketch that brought the house down had them in a pub, wearing flat caps and mufflers, fantasising about movie stars such as ████████████ and Greta Garbo.

wboncal	training	Shannon Elizabeth	The beatiful █████████████████ (American Pie)did her first major movie role.
wboncal	training	Mike Binder	That, I think, is the main message ███████████'s newest film Reign Over Me brings across.

wboncal	validation	Ned Kelly	Ledger plays █████████ with dignity and intensity, showing us how an highly spirited boy became Australia's most notorious killer.

usma92	training	Matthew Rhys	████████████ performance of the stupid boy coming to big London and sudden taking drugs from people he does noteven know does not seem very credible,
usma92	training	Chris Cooper	The film boasts an incredible performance from ████████████ who shows an amazing versatility in the exploration of his role.
usma92	training	Patricia Clarkson	█████████████████ is equally as stellar and realistic in a role that many actresses would crumble in.

usma92	training	David Boreanaz	██████████████ gives a wonderful performance as the adult male who clearly gets himself into more trouble than he can handle.
usma92	training	John Hazlett	This information was actually confirmed by the director himself ████████████ at the Q&A after the film.
usma92	training	John Hazlett	I had the pleasure of meeting ████████████ tonight who seemed like a very nice guy and was very appreciative of the comments made about the film.
usma92	training	Keith Clark	But this summer is going to be a special one as they all blackmail ███████████ 
usma92	training	Caroline Dhavernas	(██████████████████) is the ringleader who basically doesn't know what to do with her life after High School
usma92	training	Thomas Jane	It had been a while since i seen it, but it does feature ███████████ in the first role i seen him in.
usma92	training	Paulina Porizkova	█████████████████ is dressed as a cheerleader type, looking very fresh and hot.
usma92	training	Tom Selleck	Sexy and lethal, like in the one movie with ███████████, but with a never seen before malevolence.
usma92	training	Aaron Eckhart	I stumbled onto it at the video store and rented it because █████████████
usma92	training	Mickey Rourke	For you █████████████ fans...
usma92	training	Bock	I said 'no ████ don't do it. You're a doctor, a healer, you're a necessary person, you're life is meaningful'.
usma92	training	George C. Scott	Black comedy features a 'tour-de-force' performance from veteran actor ███████████████
usma92	training	Scott	Hospital is as black of a comedy as "Network" is, and the excellent cast, led by the incomparable █████, does his work full justice.
usma92	training	Pepe Le Pew	This short, a formative cartoon featuring ███████████ , concerns a cat who thinks he'll solve all his problems by pretending to be a skunk.
usma92	training	Betty Boop	After all, ██████████ was in part responsible for the Production Code coming into existance.
usma92	training	Aihara	██████, an aloof girl, will definitely make the viewers ponder who IS behind the aloof girl.
usma92	training	Yoshida	Does she love ████████
usma92	training	Ito	Or does she love ████
usma92	training	Alastair Sim	This film is funny, having great sight gags and ████████████ is great.
usma92	validation	Bill Paxton	Actor turned director ███████████ follows up his promising debut, the Gothic-horror "Frailty", with this family friendly sports drama about the 1913 U.S. Open
usma92	validation	Harry Vardon	The movie depicted well the psychological battles that ████████████ fought within himself,
usma92	validation	Shia Lebouf	I didn't realize how charming ███████████ could be.
usma92	validation	Josh Flitter	And ████████████ as the ten year old caddy threatens to steal every scene in which he appears.
usma92	validation	Stephen Dillane	███████████████ is excellent as usual,
usma92	validation	Francis	But despite these handicaps, ███████ displays courage, spirit, heroism, and humility at this world class event.
usma92	validation	Hongsheng	Maybe I'm reading into this too much, but I wonder how much of a hand █████████ had in developing the film.
usma92	validation	Jia Hongsheng	I found the █████████████ story interesting.
usma92	validation	Lennon	Like ██████, he has gained success without a loss of identity.
usma92	validation	John Lennon	His devotion to The Beatles and ███████████ is a great metaphor for his life and the helplessness he feels.
usma92	validation	Custer	The film chronicles ██████ from the moment that he arrives at West Point Academy until the Indians massacre him at the Little Big Horn.
usma92	validation	Sheridan	Indeed, ████████ was a lieutenant at this point.
usma92	validation	Moreland	So much so that in one scene it looked like it might have been ████████ hamming it up in a dress.
usma92	validation	Mickael Curtiz	After working on 7 movies with director ██████████████ (The Adventures of Robin Hood are their best achievement),
usma92	validation	Bette Davis	This is worth stressing, as he was often derided as an actor by ███████████ et al.
usma92	validation	Spencer Tracy	much better than the much vaunted █████████████ or many other stars could have done.
usma92	validation	Anthony Quinn	the young █████████████ getting a start as Crazy Horse
usma92	validation	Madonna	Plus, the acting was great, and ███████ is my idol and she did a phat job!
usma92	validation	Griffin Dunne	█████████████ plays the hapless future groom/puppet who is sent to escort her from prison to the bus station, where a series of unfortunate events occurs, thus creating the plot.
usma92	validation	Mozart	So this movie is to "The Godfather" as new wave music is to ██████.
usma92	validation	Joe Estevez	███████████ may not have his brothers career, but does a good job of bringing focus to the story
usma92	validation	Ed Harris	And █████████ will win for BEST SUPPORTING ACTOR.
usma92	validation	Cuba Gooding	Then there is a black retarded frightened but pleasant fellow, ████████████,
usma92	validation	Stewart	The rest of the film is a puzzle as ███████ tries to save them and solve the mystery.
usma92	validation	Albert Hall	The final scene takes place in ███████████ and is one of the most famous in film which lasts for 12 minutes with no dialog.
usma92	validation	Alfred Hitchcock	████████████████ shall always remain over the top of any directors of his time.
usma92	validation	Truffaut	████████ argued that the earlier version of "The Man Who Knew Too Much" lacked the depth of the later version.
usma92	validation	Reggie Malder	The casting of character actor █████████████ as the assassin, is brilliant.
usma92	validation	Max Fleischer	This was another in the series of excellent cartoons █████████████ produced for Paramount Studio.
usma92	validation	Lois Lane	With intrepid reporter █████████ as the only passenger on board,
usma92	testing	Randolph Scott	As usual, ██████████████ put in another relaxed and realistic performance.
usma92	testing	Fritz Lang	However, for the life of me, I have no idea why ██████████ was assigned to direct this film--after all, he knew nothing about Westerns.
usma92	testing	Dean Jagger	While nice guy ███████████ (sporting lots of hair) did his best to get this done, there was a bad guy just waiting to undo this for his own selfish reasons.
usma92	testing	Clive Barker	████████████, the man who brought "Hellraiser", makes a horror movie that is part-Goth, part-Mythology, and all horror in-between.
usma92	testing	Danny Elfman	The ████████████ composed score is as good as it gets, and is among his best work.
usma92	testing	Doug Bradley	The rest of the cast, which includes ████████████ is very good, save for the ridiculously over the top redneck sheriff.
usma92	testing	David Cronenberg	I love this movie, even though, as many of the reviewers have noted, the expressions of the actors (with the exception of ████████████████, who does a wonderful appearance) are rather tacky.
usma92	testing	Vincent D'Onofrio	On the outside, this film is better because of █████████████████ (Law & Order: Criminal Intent), but this film is equally as good as the 1982 version.
usma92	testing	Shemp	One of My favorite Stooges shorts with █████ is none other than Brideless Groom!
usma92	testing	Curly	I prescribe 'Brideless Groom' as medicine for anyone who thinks the Stooges' glory years ended when █████ left.
xingqidi	training	Brokeback Mountain	I have recently seen this movie due to Jake's recent success with ██████████████████.
xingqidi	training	Darth Vader	His journey carries the movie as he moves closer to his confrontation with ███████████ and his fate.
xingqidi	training	Al Pacino	And of course you have █████████ in a rather small supporting role but he's absolutely brilliant at it and outshines and overshadows every other actor in the film.
xingqidi	training	David Strathairn	Needing a role in that mold, we are given a nice turn from ████████████████.
xingqidi	training	John Forsythe	Leading the investigation is █████████████, but the other three detectives are great as well.
xingqidi	training	Citizen Kane	This adjective describes the performers; the characters; the chemistry between and among all of the characters, in whatever combination presented, and all of the supporting and even minor roles.I love films with a "harder edge:" "Rounders;" the escapist Schwarzenegger/Stallone fare; "Goodfellows;" even the classics like "Casablanca," "Gone With the Wind," "████████████."
xingqidi	training	Stanley Holloway	To the new Burgundians, however, this is an unexpected opportunity to live as they please, free from any interference from Whitehall.████████████████ is excellent as the minor city politician who suddenly finds himself leading one of the world's tiniest nations.
xingqidi	training	Abraham Lincoln	We all know of ███████████████ as the 16th president that did the emancipation and after the Civil war got assassinated.
xingqidi	training	Alpha Video	I love buying those cheap, lousy DVD's from ███████████.
xingqidi	training	Robert Montgomery	It was a careful choice - Sanders usually would play villains with occasional "nice roles" (ffoliott in FOREIGN CORRESPONDENCE, the title hero in THE STRANGE CASE OF UNCLE HARRY, the framed "best friend" of █████████████████ in RAGE IN HEAVEN).
xingqidi	training	Frank Sinatra	Seeing █████████████ when he was very young and extremely thin with sunken in cheeks and a wonderful voice which sang some great old songs.
xingqidi	training	Walt Disney	It's the same guy who maid the music for ███████████'s version of Zorro, who maid the Fightin Legion music.
xingqidi	training	Brighton Rock	I think I saw "█████████████" once many years ago and liked it but maybe I'm simply thinking fondly of the novel.)
xingqidi	training	Donkey Kong	Everything from the speaking to the SFX are pleasant and realistic.The camera angle is a bit frustrating at times, but it's the same for every platform game, like Banjo-Kazooie and ███████████ 64.I got this game as a Christmas present in 1997, and since then, I have dutifully gotten 120 stars over 10 times.
xingqidi	training	Ralph Richardson	There is far more human life in this part though, with the great ████████████████ sailing gloriously over-the-top as the small dictator, the "Boss" of the Everytown.
xingqidi	training	Greg Kinnear	Add the kind-hearted, uber-likable American "guy next door', ████████████, to set up contrast.
xingqidi	training	David Baddiel	I believe the minimal sound design and cheap camera is a conscious decision rather than bad film making, I'd defend this, the film isn't any worse as a result, and it puts the spotlight on the cast, some of whom are really good (Kate Hardie- think that's her name, as the sarcastic drunk is spot-on) the one exception being █████████████, who should never be allowed to appear in serious stuff!!
xingqidi	training	Ella Raines	Sadly ███████████ was never given such a great part again, and eventually ended up in poorly produced westerns.
xingqidi	training	Paul Lukas	Everyone is entitled to compare films they choose, but the similarities of "The Mortal Storm" and "Watch On The Rhine" are clearly the problems of refugees threatened by the Nazi juggernaut, while the main comparative point brought out with "Casablanca" is the seeming unjust treatment of Humphrey Bogart in 1943 by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Science, because they chose ██████████ instead for the Best Actor Oscar.
xingqidi	training	Ciaran Hinds	(IMO the newer A&E production suffers in that ████████████ - whom I normally adore - seems to bluster and bully his way throughout.
xingqidi	training	Marin Preda	This tells something certainly about the value, or maybe about the lack of universality of the film, but also tells something about how different history and even life of common people was in Romania compared to other countries, even in Eastern Europe.The film is an adaptation of a novel by ███████████, a controversial novelist who died during the Communist rule soon after the book was published.
xingqidi	training	Marc Dixon	"Where the Sidewalk Ends," a fairly difficult to find film -- the only copy in perhaps the best stocked video store in Manhattan was a rough bootleg from the AMC cable channel -- belongs in a category with these classics.From the moment the black cloud of opening credits pass, a curtain is drawing around rogue loner detective ██████████'s crumbling world, and as the moments pass, it inches ever closer, threatening suffocation.
xingqidi	training	Simon Peacock	It's a very gory start, and bodes well for the rest of the film.Unfortunately, after this promising beginning, things start to go seriously downhill: we are introduced to the main characters, an annoying bunch of twenty-somethings just begging to become cannibal chow, and are subjected to a fair amount of time wasting in the form of some terrible false scares, a lot of blarney about murderous druids from local Irish weirdo Gary (█████████████), and worst of all, some sub-Scream, post-modernistic conversation about the conventions of horror films (how clever!
xingqidi	training	Academy Award	It may not be █████████████ material but it is absolutely guaranteed to turn a bad day into a darn good one.
xingqidi	training	James C. Petrillo	Both of them were denounced by the president of the union, █████████████████ as strikebreakers and both did not cross the picket line again.
xingqidi	training	Nicholas Cage	It's the best role that I have ever seen for █████████████, but almost everybody seems perfectly cast.
xingqidi	training	Will Smith	I have the Highest Respects for ██████████ as he is not only a brilliant Actor but one can tell he has a genuine love for people and life which no doubt made him perfect for the character (IRS Agent Ben Thomas) he played in this film.
xingqidi	training	Paul Reiser	Obviously this is a labor of love for ███████████ who understands what it's like to be both a father and a son, as well as to have both laughter and tears as you move through life.
xingqidi	training	Alistair Cooke	It expands their critical thinking.Impartially, with the participants on all sides explaining in their own words what they did and why, it details what lead up to the war and the actual war.Buy it for your children, along with ██████████████'s America.
xingqidi	training	Heero Yuy	Purists can stick to Japanese all they want, but for a more "realistic" experience i recommend the English track since all the characters, except █████████, are not Japanese.
xingqidi	training	Mr. Wells	He did not direct after this Sci-Fi epic opera he and █████████ created, but his film imagery, sets, and design are very recognizable.That imagery is very effecting.
xingqidi	training	Mélanie Thierry	And the only one time where he was weakened is when ███████████████ shaved his beard !
xingqidi	training	Al Pacino	A lot of people are saying that █████████ over acted but I mean common obviously for a movie role like this -- a cuban drug lord you need a bit of over acting in this role with that cuban accent.
xingqidi	training	Michael Parks	Also █████████████ as modern sheriff is a bit underused in his role.
xingqidi	training	Harlan Ellison	It reminds me of ██████████████'s spooky short story, FLOP SWEAT.
xingqidi	training	Gary Busey	Unfortunately, ██████████'s role was too small and limited.
xingqidi	training	Robin Hood	This must have been very hep for 1936, but rather way way out and had nothing to do with the film, ██████████ did not make an appearance as far as I could see.
xingqidi	training	Art Director Dave Milton	This was also the first time that ████████████████████████ got a chance to spread his wings.
xingqidi	training	Michael Jackson	It's a kind of strange combination of a bio of ███████████████, a collection of musical vignettes, and a story about a super hero fighting to save some little kids.
xingqidi	training	Family Guy	Father of the Pride was the best new show to hit television since ██████████.
xingqidi	training	Harrison Ford	This is the man that made █████████████ run hard and run fast.
xingqidi	training	John Fulton	The special effects, by the always innovative ███████████, are terrific and the supporting actors are all adequate.
xingqidi	training	Imaginary Heroes	!i first got into ryan from watching the OC and then saw him in a bunch of good indies like ████████████████.
xingqidi	training	Dark Heart	Than the club & cousin bears have grown up to get ready to fight ██████████.
xingqidi	training	Sir Alan Sugar	!For fans of this i highly recommend the UK version starring ██████████████ as the boss.
xingqidi	training	Herbert Hoover	Madison is a carefree happy-go-lucky if rather irresponsible slob who's refrigerator was last cleaned probably when ██████████████ was still in the White House.
xingqidi	training	Picture Oscar	It also won the Best █████████████, being the first - and only - X-rated motion picture to do so.
xingqidi	training	Al Pacino	In a role he was born to play, █████████ stars as New York's mayor who has to deal with the shooting of a boy.
xingqidi	training	Nancy Drew	It also has encouraged my daughter to start reading the original ██████████ mysteries which I am sure she will love much as I loved the Hardy Boys.
xingqidi	training	Jane Eyre	I watched this film and then █████████ right after... she just keeps getting better.
xingqidi	validation	George Stevens	However the continual forays into comedy  such as the spiked punch routine  make this "slow" portion bearable.Producer-director ██████████████ was a natural when it came to this sort of thing, himself having cut his teeth at the Hal Roach studios, and almost exclusively having directed comedy up to this point.
xingqidi	validation	Gentleman Jim	Typical forties flick teeming w/ familiar faces and fast paced scenes, one after the other.Flynn is fine as █████████████, you never get past a 1 dimensional look at him or the rest here, I suppose, but it's okay, it's a cartoon and meant to please, that's all.
xingqidi	validation	Grace Elliot	Rohmer returns to his historical dramas in the real story of ████████████, an Englishwoman who stayed in France during the apex of the French Revolution.
xingqidi	validation	Chloe Franks	The most outstanding contribution, however, is that of the 7-year-old ████████████ who turns in chillingly effective account of her part which makes one's blood run cold.
xingqidi	validation	Miranda Richardson	It says something when ██████████████████ does her usual fine work and yet is overshadowed by so many others in the cast.
xingqidi	validation	Deep Space	The cast and crew have truly come up with something special here, and, as a whole,I would highly recommend this series to fans of The Next Generation and ██████████ 9.
xingqidi	validation	Seijun Suzuki	It just feels very fresh and original, with some imaginative use of sets and lighting, and some hints to █████████████ and Jean-Pierre Melville.
xingqidi	validation	Weird Al	I was always a big ████████ fan and when I saw this video I rented and watched it.
xingqidi	validation	Guy Kibbee	Besides those already mentioned, ██████████ is at his flustered best here.7 out of 10
xingqidi	validation	Please Obey	!Here's a message to all those brave sainik(soldier)-sons please respect the father of the nation!███████████ and happiness shall be bestowed or else it's a disaster in waiting,isn't it?
xingqidi	validation	Brock Lesnar	WWE Intercontenital championship: RVD v. ████████████ 8/10 This was a very intense and good match.
xingqidi	validation	Patrick Warburton	As a man married for 26 years, I empathize with █████████████████'s character: he loves his wife, but he assumes she knows that.
xingqidi	validation	Robert Louis Stevenson	Based on ██████████████████████'s St. Ives, the film tells the story of a dashing young French Hussar captain (Jean Marc Barr) during the Napoleonic wars.
xingqidi	validation	Franka Pontente	An excellent example of a simple idea developed into a compelling 90 minute script.The set up requires no bells and whistles, no lengthy exposition or wordy back story; Kate (███████████████), a young German business woman living in London, drifts off whilst waiting for the last tube train.
xingqidi	validation	Randy Edelman	Not only do the exteriors look authentically bleak (shot exclusively in the most run-down parts of otherwise spectacular Budapest), but █████████████'s soaring soundtrack is entirely overwhelming--and frequently our only respite from the bleak brutality.
xingqidi	validation	Dirty Harry	Despite the other comments listed here, this is probably the best ███████████ movie made; a film that reflects -- for better or worse -- the country's socio-political feelings during the Reagan glory years of the early '80's.
xingqidi	validation	Basic Instinct	She was just as good as she was in the first ██████████████.
xingqidi	validation	Steve Martin	Davis (████████████ with a great beard) asks himself 'Is my making a violent movie (and by extension our enjoyment of it) causing the violence in society?'
xingqidi	validation	Conrad L. Hall	And along the way, savor the visual brilliance of cinematographer ██████████████ (9 nominations, 2 oscars for best cinematography): rain pouring off fedoras, shots through mirrors (especially on swinging doors), tommy-gun flashes from out of the shadows, absent any sound.
xingqidi	validation	Bill Sikes	Lacking in judgment, she ignores ██████████' violent nature out of her deep need for love.
xingqidi	validation	Miss Europe	The tango also plays a plot point in "Prix," being the music she danced with on her short rise to stardom after becoming ███████████.
xingqidi	validation	Grace Hartman	█████████████, who died of cancer at age 48, did almost no film work, so it's a real pleasure that this film gives us a rare chance to see her close-up, to hear her beautiful singing voice and to notice how sexy she looks in her maid's uniform.
xingqidi	validation	Joseph Goebbels	Unarmed, unorganized, and leaderless, they faced down the most brutal forces at the disposal of the Third Reich.███████████████, the Gauleiter (governor or district leader) of Berlin, anxious to have that city racially cleansed, was also in charge of the nation's public morale.
xingqidi	validation	Bill Paxton	After all it's not everyday that someone comes in to your office to tell you that he knows who the killer is.The film has many twists, and ███████████ directs splendidly by keeping us guessing without losing interest.
xingqidi	validation	John Speredakos	This angers some of the locals--especially Otis (███████████████) and things slowly (VERY slowly) go wrong.I was expecting the worst when I started watching this.
xingqidi	validation	Ralph Faulkner	I also like the way he dispenses with Sebastian in the first episode.I watched this again because I had good memories of it from years back, there are some good stunts and good music, it has the ingredients you expect including water,rockfalls,runaway carts... Apart from the first episode(with ██████████████)the swordplay wasn't nearly as good as I remembered it, and yes it features the inevitable "flashback" episode!
xingqidi	validation	Julie Delpy	The primary reason to see "Before Sunrise," is to watch a young ███████████ deliver her lines.
xingqidi	validation	John Ford	My guess is that █████████ wanted him as a sympathetic character to give movie fans some rooting interest.
xingqidi	validation	Desert Island	Like the "█████████████" game, the film looks at how even best friends, when left alone together, can fall apart, but at the same time it shows that friends are vital to the quality of existence.
xingqidi	validation	Archibald Cunningham	Tim Roth masterfully portrays his major adversary and surely one of the most heinous and sadistic cinematic villains, ████████████████████, an egotistical, ruthless strutting peacock.
xingqidi	testing	Riff Randell	It tells the story of ████████████, adorably played by P.J.
xingqidi	testing	Robert Downey Jr	But like I said before, it's hard not to love any movie with ████████████████.
xingqidi	testing	De Sica	Neo-realism, by the way, could rightfully be claimed as this being a forefather (along with ███████'s The Children Are Watching Us), which that would take shape after the war.
xingqidi	testing	Harry Cohn	Tone/Neal/Welles are only a few -and this includes a butchered film called "The Lady From Shanghai"..."Lady From Shanghai" took two years to be released, thanks to extensive re-editing -and all because Columbia president ██████████ couldn't understand the story.
xingqidi	testing	Pierce Brosnon	Not to mention easily ██████████████'s best performance.
xingqidi	testing	Jeffrey Goines	At the same time, Cole continues talking about a dream he keeps having in which she also plays a part as a blonde woman running down the aisle, screaming for help, after shots have rung out and a particular red-headed man in a ponytail (██████████████?)
xingqidi	testing	James Bond	But overall, this game is the best ██████████ experience so far.
xingqidi	testing	Jeremy Northam	With a beautiful setting, wonderful costumes, and an outstanding cast (have I mentioned the gorgeous ██████████████?
xingqidi	testing	Dil Wale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge	Easily the best film produced in Bollywood this century.The only other Indian film I would give 10/10 for is █████████████████████████████.
xingqidi	testing	Red Queen	In fact, all the visuals are interesting with the laughing █████████ running across the bridge at night being one of my favorite moments in the film.
zwben	training	Dreyfuss	████████ was perfect as the actor/impostor, full of all the little neuroses and vanities you imagine actors to have.
zwben	training	Raul	████ Julia was superb as the Paradorian Chief of Secret Police.
zwben	training	Julia	Raul █████ was superb as the Paradorian Chief of Secret Police.
zwben	training	Sonia Braga	And ███████████ was excellent as the girl friend -- in addition to being a really hot number: "You should get an Oscar for tonight!"
zwben	training	Johnny Winters	Let us not forget ██████████████ as the CIA agent and the several guest stars playing themselves: Sammy Davis Jr., Ike Pappas, Dick Cavett -- all perfectly done.. All in all, a memorable romp under the Paradorian moon.. -R.

zwben	training	Raul Julia	While "The Kiss of the Spider Woman" cast ██████████ as a political prisoner in an unidentified Latin American country, this time he works for a dictator in a fictional Latin American country.
zwben	training	Richard Dreyfuss	Specifically, the dictator suddenly drops dead, so Julia replaces el presidente with a Broadway actor (████████████████) shooting a movie in the country.
zwben	training	Dreyfuss	From there, ████████ has to figure out how to be a dictator, all the while balancing it with his own life.. Is it appropriate to turn the tense situation in Latin America into comedy?
zwben	training	Richard Dreyfuss	It just goes to show why ████████████████ is one of the greatest actors of our era, and what we lost when Raul Julia died.

Flippen, Tony Curtis, Rock Hudson among them  and Mann's outstanding visual sense raise the bar with this one.

zwben	validation	Stewart	All five films had the revenge and the dark past on ███████'s part play into the film, to the point where this is not just ███████'s dark side, but also actually a sort of character, not one to be listed in the credits, but one that you can only recognize and know that it is there, always present.
zwben	validation	Stewart	However, this one, not just on revenge and the dark past, but also in terms of supreme danger, and characters that were very different than ███████ make it surpass the other four in all aspects.

rheahanks	test	Darwin	All ██████'s missing links are still MISSING !

rheahanks	test	Rik Mayall	And ██████████, you can do better, so please, do!"
rheahanks	test	Rudy Ray Moore	Since ██████████████ was originally a comedian, I begin to wonder if this film was meant to be a spoof or a serious action film.
rheahanks	test	Spalding Gray	Three of the things you can say about █████████████ are: he certainly marched to the beat of his own "drummer;" he was never at a loss for words; and he obviously felt that those watching and listening to him would be interested in every aspect of his life, experiences and thoughts - no matter how trivial at times.
rheahanks	test	Willie Green	With this army of kung fu fighting "hoes" (his words, not mine) on his side, he plans to take back the nightclub from ████████████.

rheahanks	training	Ben Stiller	The acting was what you would expect especially out of ███████████.
rheahanks	training	Bettina Hirsch	Directed by ██████████████ this has to be one of the worst horror comedy's ever
rheahanks	training	Bill	The acting for the most part is very wooden (the only exception is Adrien Brody’s performance as Solo's creator ████) and the story is slight enough that you would probably forget it WHILST you where watching the film.

rheahanks	training	Daniel Roebuck	The best performance however is definitely ██████████████.
rheahanks	training	De Niro	In the past I've thought ███████ to be a cold and unexpressive actor given horribly to mugging when called upon to do comedy.
rheahanks	training	Dennis Hopper	█████████████ (on the comeback trail with this, "Blue Velvet", and "Hoosiers") gives a great performance as the creepy yet pathetic hippie generation leftover.

rheahanks	training	Jonathan Scarfe	the brothers were totally convincing, and ███████████████ was perfect in the challenging role of Luke.

rheahanks	training	Marjorie Main	It's sort of like pairing Sir Lawrence Olivier with █████████████.
rheahanks	training	Mitch	She thinks that █████ will give her the `edgy' boost it needs to be a hit but feels he may be too unlikable to carry the whole show by himself.

rheahanks	validation	Ed Norton	This is right around the same time she appeared with Richard Gere and █████████ in PRIMAL FEAR, a movie that helped guarantee her stardom.
rheahanks	validation	Eddie	Can't forget when █████ is on his motorbike, and he needs to urinate....
rheahanks	validation	Herman	██████ has made northern drama his own with Little Voice and Brassed Off, but the formula falters in this ropey, flat and contrived tale of two teenage delinquents trying to get season tickets to see Newcastle.
rheahanks	validation	Herman	I am all for entertainment, and ██████'s track record shows he is aware of the need to balance the social message with laughs and tears.
rheahanks	validation	Jackie	I've only seen one ██████ film worse that this one and that was one of his early forays into Hollywood films that didn't turn out so well.
rheahanks	validation	Jackie Chan	I normally love ███████████ movies but this one was terrible.
rheahanks	validation	James Cagney	This is what ████████████ is all about, wisecracks, cockiness, hard as nails and no-nonsense charisma.
rheahanks	validation	Joe	Despite all its technical short-comings, this is an interesting film depicting a day in the life of ███, a hustler, determined to earn $200 for his wife's pregnant girl friend.
rheahanks	validation	Joe	One thing is certain, ███ is uninhibited when it comes to disrobing for sex or posing for an artist.
rheahanks	validation	Joe	███ stark naked is crouching on the floor feeding crumbs of cake to his little baby.
rheahanks	validation	Joe	Another scene of amusing interest is the one in which ███ desperately seeks a loan of $100 from a gym friend, coming to the point of asking in a very circuitous approach.
rheahanks	validation	Joe	It's a preliminary to another occasion when ███ divests himself of his clothes and poses as the discus thrower in true classical style.
rheahanks	validation	Joe	At the end of the film we gain the impression that we have got to know ███ pretty well.
rheahanks	validation	Joe Dallesandro	███████████████ is outstanding as the easy-going, passive, laid-back young man who is willing to let the other person do most of the talking while he listens with a faraway look in his eyes.
rheahanks	validation	Laura Linney	████████████ of all people is along for this bumpiest of rides.
rheahanks	validation	Neil Labute	only real complaint is that director ███████████ (who made a splash a few years ago with the very impressive and dark In the Company of Men') relied much too heavily on many cliched Hollywood conventions.
rheahanks	validation	Nick Hammond	I didn't think ████████████ was Peter Parker... and he was visibly of a different build than the guy who did the stunts in the spider suit.

rheahanks	validation	Seth McFarlane	Reason 2, The jokes are just generally hilarious, ██████████████ and the other writers are soooooooooooo funny, everything from the Star Wars references to making fun of celebrities, i love them all.
rheahanks	validation	Stephen Dorff	█████████████ does the best job of the whole cast here, as the "head" vampire you just love to hate.
rheahanks	validation	Tobey Macguire	Granted, I can also spot in the modern Spider-Man movies when I am looking at ██████████████ and when I am looking at CGI.
rheahanks	validation	Willie Green	However, the sympathetic warden (the only white character in the whole movie that isn't completely evil or incompetent) decides to spring him free to stop the evil ████████████ and his drug trafficking.
biswas-n	training	Pleasance	Rose is good, but it's █████████ who really stands out in this film.
biswas-n	training	Capt Dan	████████ is in love with a woman.
biswas-n	training	Raul Julio	I'll always remember the name ██████████ for this picture.
biswas-n	training	Tom Selleck	You have to like baseball, and you have to at least sort of like ███████████, but if you meet those criteria you should thoroughly enjoy this movie.
biswas-n	training	Charlie Sheen	The Middle East can no longer be written off as a sthole full of rag heads knocking each other off to quote █████████████ here it is now a place in which involvement can lead to severe consequences.
biswas-n	training	James Caan	The film, however, with a strong debut for ██████████, remains effective and affecting.
biswas-n	training	Atwill	██████ is as close to cardboard in this role as he could get.
biswas-n	training	Cat Soup	████████ is one of those films that, from Western eyes, is supposed to be experienced on drugs or deeply analyzed.
biswas-n	training	Chin	The parallel Roman world dominance West and East worlds was achieved without a single towering personality like ████.
biswas-n	training	Wesley Snipes	Don't waist your time this movie snt entertaining, if you wanna cry it might suffice though, even though your tears will be wept due to seeing █████████████ in the tragic action film wannabe comedy...
biswas-n	training	Mark Mothersbough	The song when they go to the Ping Islands is a really good electronic song by █████████████████, and the second I heard it I knew I had to download it.
biswas-n	training	Vidor	I normally dislike █████, who tended to be cast in glamour roles but wasn't pretty enough to justify them.
biswas-n	training	John Cleese	Let's not forget ███████████
biswas-n	training	Jess	████ loves to play pick up soccer games, the kind forbidden by her traditionalist mother.
biswas-n	training	Daryl Hannah	Sometimes ████████████ can seem a little spacy in her film roles, but its exactly that quality that makes her so perfect in the part of Madison.
biswas-n	training	Bronson	Chief tries to scare him off, but only makes his point after ███████ has been shot and has no other choice.
biswas-n	training	Tom ValcoJames Gandolfiniis	███████████████████████████ reluctant, but is greedy enough to take Drew's offer.
biswas-n	training	Joanna Pacula	█████████████ is OK.
biswas-n	training	Oscar	I liked the part where when those two British neighbors that speak to both gentlemen, and after █████ kicked out Felix, he gets lucky and lives with them when he refused to have dinner with them the night earlier.
biswas-n	training	Fifi	Let's get to the guys who went after Goucem's neighbor ████, what is their real motivation
biswas-n	training	J. Carrol Naish	Imagine ███████████████ as an insane doctor with dentures so fake the rattle with every word that comes out of his mouth.
biswas-n	training	Ben	███ is very nervous with his new patient, who forces compliments and demands upon him.
biswas-n	training	Lawn Bowlsbr	Go see it and learn the joys of ████████████
biswas-n	training	Ian	███ believes they're trapped in a culdesac and leaves them there.
biswas-n	training	Debbie	A rather sad bit was when ██████ tried and failed to match her shouty style which spoiled it a bit.
biswas-n	training	Brendon	███████ starts out straight but gets to learn that gay may be more than just an option for him and being bisexual might not be that bad after all.
biswas-n	training	Tim Boggs	This movie would apparently be the only movie █████████ ever directed, but he did go on to work in the industry for some notable movies.The baddie of this movie is some undeveloped old man character.
biswas-n	training	Inder Kumar	After Dil, Beta, Mann and Masti, ███████████'s this flick proves that he is a king of comedy.
biswas-n	training	Hari Om	Was very fortunate to see the movie ███████ at The Bermuda International Film Festival.
biswas-n	training	Gina Gershon	Here's a little nugget made for cable that revolves around a psychiatrist played by ████████████.
biswas-n	training	Brendan Filone	██████████████ is the best.
biswas-n	training	Olsen	Getting There I found too predictable, contrived and slow, and to this day I still consider it as the █████ twins' worst.
biswas-n	training	Waldemar	Unluckily for ████████ the cave belongs to two evil Vampire, cannibal, ancient god worshipping, nymphomaniac twin sisters.
biswas-n	training	Stevens	███████, perhaps the ablest filmmaker of the era next to Hitchcock, saw the profundity and catharsis in it, and the receptive, insightful control and room to allow his particularly personal vision to make it feel like the experience cinema is meant to be, a chronicle ensuing the lifechanging happening of falling in love, and the innate personal longing to make a family and a home with the one you worship, and the trials and grief that can be as intense, though never really more, than the pleasure and gratification it begets.
biswas-n	training	Jeff	Later, ████ - This looks decidedly like "the amateur" hour.
biswas-n	training	Antwone Fisher	██████████████ stands proudly alone in this regard race is irrelevant, save for one fight that may, or may not, have been provoked by a racial slur.
biswas-n	training	Max	In conclusion, don't watch it, but if you have nothing better to do with your life and you don't feel like renting Mad ███, you might watch this, if it will ever pass on tv.
biswas-n	training	Sandra Bullock	The acting is lousy sorry, ██████████████, but even your performance was horrible, the music score could have come from a bad xrated movie and the story was downright ridiculous.
biswas-n	training	Peter O'Toole	█████████████ has either had a really bad plastic surgery, or he is desperately in need of one.
biswas-n	training	Ridley Scott's	The Thing, the movie itself, is similar to ██████████████ iconic "Alien" 1979.
biswas-n	training	Lindy	█████ is unsinkable, a positive character that makes lemonade out of lemons.
biswas-n	training	Buck Henry	The only honest performance was turned in by ██████████, who plays a raving mental patient of course, since he also wrote the screenplay for this abomination, it was probably only typecasting.
biswas-n	training	Bogdanovich	In the meantime, the budding couple's respective children nepotism alert ███████████'s daughters spew cute and pick up some fairly disturbing pointers on 'love' while observing their parents.
biswas-n	training	Camelia Kath	And as for ████████████, I've seen better looking scarecrows in farmer's fields.
biswas-n	training	Hitler	But this miniseries is powerful and convincing because the talented cast really captures the dark truth of ██████'s world.
biswas-n	training	Alain Delon	For those seeking entertainment, watch the ███████████ thrillers featured in the DVD extras.
biswas-n	training	Sticky Fingers	There were a lot of rumors that said ██████████████ couldn't act.
biswas-n	training	Alice	The only one I felt for to some degree was █████, you could literally feel the stress she's under for having to negotiate between the writer and the network guys, always pretending it's not all that bad and everything is hunkydory.
biswas-n	training	Schwarzenegger	Unlike End of Days' or The Sixth Day', classic ██████████████ action films like Predator' never insult the audience by attempting to explain the often threadbare plot.
biswas-n	training	Kareena	Well if you really listen closely, whatever they speak is actually unintelligible.Camera work is bad, editing is not present, background score gives a headache, action is shoddy, dialogs are unintelligible, Acting is abysmal and well ███████ used to look like a wrestler, now she looks like a starved wrestler.
biswas-n	validation	John Carpenter's	Hm...but not if the sponsors saw "████████████████ Vampires".
biswas-n	validation	Temujin	The main reason for this is that the story of ███████ is rooted in a culture quite alien to the filmmakers and which they make little attempt to understand.
biswas-n	validation	Nolan	A fisherman █████ is out to nab a killer whale, a very bad thing, but when he accidentally ACCIDENTALLY mark you hits a pregnant cow instead of her mate, the cow and I use the word in all senses who is obviously a sick psychobitch and the canonical villain of the piece throws herself against the propellers trying to chew herself to bits in the most distressing and hideous not to mention ineffectual method of killing herself.
biswas-n	validation	Muriel	She doesn't get many of the funnier lines, but she combines her special blend of flightiness and sauciness to make ██████ an appealing character on her own.
biswas-n	validation	Libby	My favourite episodes are the one where she turns █████ into a geek, the first episode, the true love episode and most of the rest from the first series.
biswas-n	validation	John Savage	Poor ███████████ had to stoop this low in order to be in another movie.
biswas-n	validation	Anita Strindberg	Sexy ████████████████ is absolutely ravishing in the female lead.
biswas-n	validation	Dani Levy	Director and coscriptwriter █████████ does not bother about those mechanics, he thinks that certain things simply ARE funny, the fact that two orderlies are gay and kiss over a man in a coma, for example.
biswas-n	validation	Mick McCleery	The only real problem was the lead, █████████████.
biswas-n	validation	Murphy	He turns to ██████ as an ally of convenience.
biswas-n	validation	Burakov	I was almost in tears when he told ███████ how the FBI had so closely followed and admired his work.
biswas-n	validation	Jane	Plain ████, but maybe the director was dating her or something.
biswas-n	validation	Laurence Harvey	It also helps the movie that it features ███████████████ as the movie it's prime suspect.
biswas-n	validation	Ahmed	A noble, nicelooking sorry, I had to add that in, young thief named █████ who sneaks into the palace with the help of a magic rope and tries to steal, but changes his ways when he falls for the Caliph's daughter.
biswas-n	validation	Steven Seagal	I like █████████████
biswas-n	validation	Dolittle	Dr. ████████ has ended and number 2 starts.
biswas-n	validation	George Orwell	But for English this year, year 11, we had to read Animal Farm, also by █████████████.
biswas-n	validation	Ninza Turtles	I saw very many, much was pleasant to me were a favorite "█████████████", and from "ThunderCats" I then saw only one episode about huge spiders, but they have sunk down to me in soul and later 20 years they ThunderCats is my favorite cartoon serial from serious and from comic "The Pink Panther" and I now try to extract a full serial on disks in the original without a translation into Russian.
biswas-n	validation	Stephen King 	mostly for the first 25 minsI love █████████████I read most of his books not this oneand there are some good and of course some bad
biswas-n	validation	Mike Nicholas's Closer	Law is once again reprising his similar role in ██████████████████████, which was unfortunately a disappointment to the fan of Law who wish to see something new and different from him.
biswas-n	validation	Jennifer Lopez	I don't really enjoy ██████████████.
biswas-n	validation	Meh	███, I am not going to be angry at this movie, i knew what i was getting into and if you're looking for a bad movie to watch with friends, here's what I recommend Watch this movie, then immediately watch Jurassic Park and then Lost World back to back.
biswas-n	validation	max	And even worse, the incessant, walltowall music, dull and hypnotic to the ███, opens up a giant chasm between the film and the viewer.
biswas-n	validation	Matt	Especially with her remarks about 'going to the funeral of her best friend', when she first meets ████.
biswas-n	validation	Michelle Pieffer	████████████████ is very ironic and cynical.
biswas-n	validation	Ryan	████ already in Columbia, will join the party.
biswas-n	validation	Ray Bolger	And like clowns, scarecrows can be very creepy unless they look like ██████████, of course.
biswas-n	validation	James Bond	However, it's this spoof of all spy and psychedelic series ██████████, the Man from U.N.C.L.E. and the Monkees among others which makes this series worth to watch.
biswas-n	validation	Milo	████ wants Glory back at any price.
biswas-n	validation	Gregory	First, there is very little of Ms. ███████'s book in this script.
biswas-n	testing	Scully	But The XFiles had a good thing going, and ██████ was one of the strongest and most idiosyncratic TV characters of the 90s.
biswas-n	testing	Monroe	██████ died before the movie was completed and it was canned.
biswas-n	testing	Crowe	█████ does Butch one better by blowing them all to pieces.
biswas-n	testing	Zizek	fact that █████ overfocuses on two of the most overrated directors and ones whose films often LACK intelligence, if anything such as Hitchcock and Lynch, only further diminishes his already low credibility.
biswas-n	testing	Dalton	I'm afraid the 1983 ██████ version just doesn't do anything for me.
biswas-n	testing	Keane	You begin to feel █████'s pain and anguish.
biswas-n	testing	Heather Grahm	█████████████ has done much better things since.
biswas-n	testing	Mitchell	Apparently the film takes some liberties with the true facts, but ████████ believed in the power of the airplane in war and wanted an upgrade in air power for the U.S. as well as the creation of an Air Force.
biswas-n	testing	Mermaid	I've seen other Guinea Pig films, like ███████ in a Manhole He Never Dies, and while they're pretty sick, they at least have a bit of a sense of humor to them however dark.
biswas-n	testing	Lew Ayres	█████████, who had just made a name for himself in ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT, stars as a "nice" and "respectable" mob leader.
minhtriet136	training	Calvin	This twisted comedy is well acted and directed. Very funny and the production quality is outstanding. It is easy to see why this short film has been accepted into so many festivals and won awards. Everyone can identify with ██████ having a bad day, bad week, bad life.
minhtriet136	training	Richard Moll	████████████ brings darkness and foreboding that gives this film just the right twistedness. The old man adds to the humor of the story.
minhtriet136	training	Travis Davis	Great performances, excellent camera work and editing---this short is a classic from start to finish. Kudos to ████████████ for pulling double duty as both director and star
minhtriet136	training	Woody Allen	He's the funniest nebbish since ███████████
minhtriet136	training	Richard Moll	And what a treat to see ████████████ back again
minhtriet136	training	Stephen Garvey	This gem of a film showcases the brilliantly funny writing of ██████████████
minhtriet136	training	Steve Garvey	██████████████ is the true current king of quirky comedy.
minhtriet136	training	Suzy Parker	A sincere tribute to ███████████, who's just passed away.
minhtriet136	training	Miss Parker	Not only is TBoE one of the cheesiest movies ever made, but ███████████'s performance is, in this cheesy-movie-lover's opinion, among the worst performances of all time
minhtriet136	training	Joan Crawford	One of █████████████’s last performances as the driven successful editor vs. all those young beautiful eager beavers fresh out of the elite Seven Sister Colleges
minhtriet136	training	Robert Evans	Interesting cameo by ████████████ as a rich cad.
minhtriet136	training	Robert Evans	Here is one of the few films in which once big time producer ████████████
minhtriet136	training	Joan Crawford	It also features a mature █████████████ and terrific supporting cast. Check it out.
minhtriet136	training	Amanda Farrell	Then there's ██████████████ who did succeed professionally, but whose personal life has been sacrificed for an office with her name on the door
minhtriet136	training	Joan Crawford	A classic late 50's film. The superannuated headliners (█████████████ and Louis Jordan) are not at their best, but the direction, cinematography, and acting of the younger cast are compelling.
minhtriet136	training	Suzy Parker	This movie could be called a tearjerker with the saddest part involving ███████████'s character whose obsession of an ex-boyfriend leads to tragedy
minhtriet136	training	Scott Clark	Also interesting is ███████████, who plays Grant, the kid in the wheelchair
minhtriet136	training	Graves	They are also correct that one of the best performances of this movie was that of Dr. ██████
minhtriet136	training	Tex Avery	█████████'s tenure as director of cartoons for MGM was in the 1940s and 50s was one of the brightest moments in cartoon history
minhtriet136	training	Droopy	Throughout the film, despite many insane stunts, ██████ keeps up with this crook until eventually the wolf gives up because ██████ is seemingly everywhere
minhtriet136	training	Tex Avery	This animated short is a remake of one of █████████'s earlier shorts for Fred Quimby at M-G-M
minhtriet136	training	McPoodle	It manages to get most of it's laughs from the shocked reactions Joe has whenever he encounters ████████
minhtriet136	training	Simon Templar	As usual, █████████████ ("The Saint") meets a lady in distress and comes to her aid
minhtriet136	training	Paul Guilfoyle	Along the way, he meets some interesting supporting characters (this time, ██████████████ as "Pearly" Gates) and during his unraveling of this not especially compelling mystery (none of them really are)
minhtriet136	training	George Sanders	██████████████ is once again the consummate sophisticated British do-gooder and he succeeds once again in making an excellent B-detective series film
minhtriet136	training	George Sanders	██████████████ is so charming and, yes, low-key that all that talent, smarts, physical presence and above all, masculinity, seem, well, almost normal
minhtriet136	training	George Clooney	██████████████ can not begin to master the scene as Mr. Sanders does (and does without Mr. Clooney's mugging)
minhtriet136	training	Jonathan Hale	█████████████ simply is Inspector Fernack
minhtriet136	training	Paul Guilfoyle	██████████████ plays a mobster who goes straight (and drinks milk) because he cannot take the pressure
minhtriet136	training	Wendie Barrie	Story begins on an ocean liner headed to the U.S. where the Saint meets but cannot connect with █████████████
minhtriet136	training	Fernack	The Saint assists Inspector ███████ clear his name from a frame
minhtriet136	training	Kristine	I guess since ████████ was of age, it was held against her and her promising career came grinding to a halt
minhtriet136	training	Ronald Reagan	I guess its all in the timing (witness Pam Anderson's career)--but █████████████ was in charge during Kristine's debacle (we had not heard about Nancy Reagan's affairs)
minhtriet136	training	Monica Lewinski	Bill Clinton and ███████████████ were in full swing during Pam's "coming out
minhtriet136	training	Kristine DeBell	I thought ███████████████ was GREAT and was glad to see her move on into some more interesting roles
minhtriet136	training	Steven Spielberg	She's in ████████████████’s "I Wanna Hold Your Hand" and Barbara Streisand's "The Main Event" and Bill Murray's "Meatballs"
minhtriet136	training	Kristine	But her starring role in Alice in Wonderland puts the focus right where it ought to be, right on ████████ as the center of attention
minhtriet136	training	Richard Prior	Fine performances particularly the Kristine DeBell in the lead and was that an unaccredited █████████████ as the prone Knight being vigorously (if discreetly) ridden?
minhtriet136	training	Sacha barren Cohen	i think ██████████████████ was Very and i do mean Very good
minhtriet136	training	Ali	Very intelligent language usage of ███, which you musn't miss! In one word: (eeh sentence...) Wicked, so keep it real and pass it on!
minhtriet136	training	Ali G	The thing with █████ is that he takes the mick out of himself and his character
minhtriet136	training	Sacha Baron Cohen	██████████████████ is a genius
minhtriet136	training	Ali G 	I've liked █████ since the first time I saw the material from the show
minhtriet136	training	Jeff Lieberman	Deborah Benson very good plays the heroine and director ██████████████ created very creepy and dark movie
minhtriet136	training	Jeff Lieberman	██████████████ as a director of this 1981 low budget film does and excellent job and with his other works
minhtriet136	training	Texas Chainsaw Massacre	Even though this is a killer in the woods flick like Friday,it has more in common with the original ███████████████████████
minhtriet136	training	Jeff Lieberman	Director ██████████████ creates terrific atmosphere of dread and despair
minhtriet136	training	Jeff Lieberman	██████████████'s "Just Before Dawn" is definitely one of the most underrated horror movies ever made
minhtriet136	training	Ken Stott	Gripping drama and █████████ was brilliant
minhtriet136	training	DCI Red Metcalfe	Hopefully we have not seen the last of ████████████████.
minhtriet136	validation	Messiah	Although it was scheduled on BBC in three parts I watched ███████ on video in one take
minhtriet136	validation	George Hilton	█████████████ never really grabs me like Franco Nero or Clint Eastwood
minhtriet136	validation	Felipe Martinez	This is the first movie of the director ███████████████ and I really except this movie will be the beginning of a great career as a film director
minhtriet136	validation	Francois Perrin	In French it's narrated by ███████████████, usually good and familiar with beautiful documentaries, but the text is not good at all
minhtriet136	validation	LUC BESSON	Although compared with "Mad Max", this film is in a league of its own. Set in post apocalyptic Paris, this film is about man's struggle for survival, he has lost his ability to speak, and there is a remarkable shortage of women. CONGRATULATIONS ██████████!
minhtriet136	validation	Richard Gere	Diane Lane was wonderful as always, ████████████ isn't an over-actor
minhtriet136	validation	Diane Lane	The chemistry between Richard gere and ██████████e was very believable (fantastic acting on both parts)
minhtriet136	validation	Chris Stokes	I think ████████████ did a pretty good job, considering that is was his first movie.
minhtriet136	validation	Tim Thomerson	Funny guy █████████████ (who steals the show as Blinkin in Robin Hood-Men In Tights) is downright hilarious as the anal retentive Dr. Jekyll and the sex crazed Hyde
minhtriet136	validation	Jekyll and Hyde	At times sophomoric, at others, bitingly satirical and witty, ███████████████ is mostly just a near perfect reflection of the times
minhtriet136	validation	Mel Brookes	███████████ made some remakes of classic films.He made some very strong contributions
minhtriet136	validation	Chaplin	███████ enters the trenches of WWI in this spirited comedy that never belittles the horrors of war
minhtriet136	validation	Dutchess	This movie is about a cat mom named ████████ and her 3 kittens. ████████ and the kittens love music.
minhtriet136	validation	Thomas	██████ gets to love music like the other cats. ██████ and Dutchess really like each other
minhtriet136	validation	William Macy	████████████ is stellar, as always, and Adam Arkin offers one of his better performances
minhtriet136	validation	Fargoesque	It is ██████████, and was a lot of fun to watch. It held my attention all the way through and did not seem to lag at all
minhtriet136	validation	Bill Macy	Not a stunner, but a good movie to see once or twice. █████████ shows he can do more than just act; his writing was pretty darn good
minhtriet136	validation	Jamie Cromwell	Great supporting cast, especially ██████████████ as the extortionist private eye
minhtriet136	validation	Jerry Lundergaard	The movie's greatest strength is the work of Macy, who reminds us of his █████████████████ role from Fargo
minhtriet136	validation	Dennis Quaid	████████████ is supurb as Dexter, a man doomed to die and Meg Ryan excellent as his babe.
minhtriet136	validation	Dennis Quaid	Instead, enjoy a gripping performance from ████████████ and visual imagery to commend.
minhtriet136	validation	Vincent D'Onofrio	Fun, also, to see █████████████████ and Mary-Louise Parker so early in their careers.
minhtriet136	validation	Murphy	If you're a fan of De Niro or ██████, you're going to enjoy this movie.
minhtriet136	validation	DeNiro	██████ and Murphy simply had fun making this movie, so should we (watching it)
minhtriet136	validation	Rene Russo	██████████ also evened out the rest of the cast perfectly, establishing her role so it does not interfere with the budding relationship between De Niro and Murphy.
minhtriet136	validation	Robert De Niro	██████████████ was on top of his game, delivering his lines with such aplomb, one has to believe this is his everyday demeanor
minhtriet136	validation	First Mate	After being discovered by the ██████████ and his henchmen, they were held captive
minhtriet136	validation	Walker and Luke	Shortly after, when ███████████████ are taken to the Sheriff's dept. to being examined by the lies detection machine, things turn out to be very different..
minhtriet136	validation	John Corbett	I find it hard to believe that a judge would change his sentence rendered immediately in the courtroom, even after such a heartfelt speech by the brother (gorgeous ████████████), but overall the story was very gripping
minhtriet136	validation	John Corbett	███████████████ is one of the most talented actors out there, and the guy who played Luke was really good too. Highly recommend.
minhtriet136	test	Liv Ullmann	I can't wait for the DVD release, as hopefully it will contain comments by ███████████, who will finally explain what she was thinking when she agreed to do this film!
minhtriet136	test	Sir John Gielgud	Who can forget ████████████████ smiling uneasily in his Dali Lhama outfit, overseeing an interpretive dance to the Republican party ("Family")?
minhtriet136	test	Bobby Van	And my favourite, █████████ embodying the strength of America's education system
minhtriet136	test	Liv Ullmann	As for all the reviewers who claimed the cast cannot sing in tune, this criticism falls apart since ███████████, Olivia Hussey and Peter Finch were dubbed
minhtriet136	test	Lost Horizon	I wouldn't claim for a second that ████████████ is a masterpiece 
minhtriet136	test	Richard Greico	I thought this was movie was great, ██████████████ and Yasmine Bleeth have great chemistry in this movie
minhtriet136	test	Keith Richards	As ██████████████ remarks in Paul McCartney's movie about Holly, there's some Buddy Holly in almost all rock made since his day
minhtriet136	test	Gary Busey	██████████ does a remarkable, energetic portrayal of Holly, and his performances hint that he really gets into the music.
minhtriet136	test	Gary Busey	The Buddy Holly Story is a great biography with a super performance from ██████████. Busey did his own singing for this film and he does a great job.
minhtriet136	test	Emanuele Crialese	So if this will not be a real reviveing for the Italian cinema it is an extraordinary evolution for █████████████████ after his 'Respiro' another definitive beautiful film
RamRao	training	Sadako	In Jôji Iida  "Rasen", ██████ explained that the reason behind her curse towards unfortunates was for others to experience pure fear, the same kind of fear she went through all alone at the bottom of a darkened well.
RamRao	training	Sadako	   In Norio Tsuruta  "Bâsudei", the "██████" series continues, except this time we follow a young woman, named ██████(Yukie Nakama), haunted by a ghoulish alter ego with considerable power.
RamRao	training	Hiroshi Tôyama	A sound effects engineer, ██████████████(Seiichi Tanabe), seems to be the only one who accepts her without contention, actually encouraging once she receives the leading role after the actress dies under suspicious, and very unusual, circumstances.
RamRao	training	Sadako	The troupe and crew soon come to the understanding, thanks to a news reporter who instigates a lynch mob after the director(..who initiates a traumatic situation, accusing ██████, an actress he put in position to become a star, of killing the lead actress)is found murdered, his body discovered by a stage hand, that they are accursed(..her photographer  snapshots reveal their distorted faces and other disturbing images).
RamRao	training	Sadako	   A different approach to the "Ringu" series this time making ██████ a sympathetic figure, a young woman tormented by others when, in fact, she is as much a victim as those whose lives are harmed by the vengeful ghoul.
RamRao	training	Sadako	The ghoul is, in a sense, ██████  "protector", a kind of spectre that haunts the theater, and we see how the troupe and crew always respond to our heroine with disdain and disregard.
RamRao	training	Sadako	Tôyama becomes her sole friend and confident and their blossoming romance is the heart and soul of "Ringu 0-Birthday", as he attempts to rescue her from all those that find ██████ a threat..to no avail.
RamRao	training	Sadako	"Bâsudei" actually has two major climaxes, the theatrical production which spirals out of control when it should've been ██████  finest hour on stage, and the discovery of where Ikuma had been hiding the alter ego, the lynch mob, behind an attack on our heroine, coming in contact, face-to-face with a fate worse than death.
RamRao	training	Ikuma	Potent finale, reiterating what I mentioned in the opening sentence of my user comment, as we witness █████  decision to "end all of it" in regards to Sadako.
RamRao	training	Nolte	All logic is thrown into the wind, and the viewer  intelligence is insulted and pounded upon repeatedly with more force than that baseball bat could ever have generated - the one used by █████ and McGregor.
RamRao	training	Nolte	█████ was molesting corpses decades earlier and the writers of this film would have us believe that this man could years later become the city  chief police investigator
RamRao	training	Thomas Edison	Making him the killer is as absurd as giving █████████████ credit for inventing the wheel, as laughable as a conspiracy-theory plot from the "X-Files", and as stupid as Kim Basinger  book on how to solve all of world  problems (if she'd ever write one).
RamRao	training	Nolte	This is an essential piece of the puzzle that is badly missing here; McGregor JUST HAPPENS to get a job where he meets █████.
RamRao	training	Brolin	And McGregor  best friend, ██████, JUST HAPPENS to know a prostitute who is Nolte  play toy (and later victim).
RamRao	training	Brolin	And to add some silliness, ██████ is some kind of a deranged thrill-seeker who acts like a total lunatic all the time.
RamRao	training	Brolin	And how the hell did ██████ get into the mortuary when he carried out his "practical joke"?
RamRao	training	Nolte	And how the hell did █████ manage to drag out a body of one of his victims within seconds of McGregor entering the room, without McGregor noticing it (the fact that he had his walkman on and/or was singing and/or talking doesn't make it any more believable)?
RamRao	training	Nolte	And what  with this annoying scene where Arquette JUST HAPPENS to walk into the mortuary at exactly the moment when McGregor is hitting █████ with a baseball bat and predictably starts thinking her boyfriend is the killer??
RamRao	training	Brolin	More annoyances came from the scene in which ██████  reaction to McGregor  telling him that the latter is been suspected of murder is to laugh
RamRao	training	Sadako	 This movie focuses on how ██████ becomes the murdering spirit.
RamRao	training	Sadako	This sort of ruins the image of the evil ██████ spirit we know from the other Ringu movies.
RamRao	training	Hannibal Rising	In that regard this movie suffers from the same problem as "███████████████".
RamRao	training	Sadako	For instance I never saw ██████ as a young adult but more as a 12 year old child or so.
RamRao	training	Carrie	You can see this movie as "Ringu" meets "██████", since this movie story- and character-wise definitely show some similarities to the Brian De Palma horror classic "██████", from 1976.
RamRao	training	Sadako	The film fleshes out the back story of the Ring trilogies' demon / troubled soul, ██████, (played by Yukie Nakama), following her attempts to join an acting troupe and at the same time cope with her troubled psyche and the events of her mysterious past that still engulf her.
RamRao	training	Sadako	 The film itself has a fundamentally creepy atmosphere throughout but as with many prequels never really equals the original story, in this case never really delivering the same level of suspense, (although it does come close a couple of times), and failing to shock in the way the original did with ██████ being a silent Reagan, (The Exorcist), type character staring at you hatefully through a horrifically blood shot eye, peering through a nest of slimy, sinister, long black hair.
RamRao	training	Sadako	This sees a lot of the scenes shot inside a theatre, which provides a suitably eerie backdrop for ██████  doomed quest to lead a normal life and battle the demons of her past that lurk ever closer.
RamRao	training	Sadako	 With regards to filling in the blanks left open in Ring and Ring 2, this film does very little, for we are already aware that ██████ was pushed to the bottom of the well by her step father, and only hints at the source of the true evil lurking inside her, without giving a clue of its origin or past.
RamRao	training	Seiichi Tanabe	 The actors do a reasonably good job throughout, with a special hats off to ██████████████ who conveyed the confused yet blindly in love hero Tôyama.
RamRao	training	Nakama	██████ brought a certain level of pity to the role of Sadako, a girl seemingly running away from the evil that surrounds and trying to do the right thing.
RamRao	training	Graham Norton	Ireland may have given the world hurling, green beer, █████████████, and that funny dancing where the arms don't move, but it isn't exactly renowned for its horror movies.
RamRao	training	Paddy Breathnach	Shrooms, a psychological chiller from director ████████████████, is unlikely to change that fact.
RamRao	training	Breathnach	 Rather than tell a straightforward scary story, ██████████ unwisely chooses to blur the line between what is reality and what is merely a figment of a drug-addled mind.
RamRao	training	Boyd	The chemistry between ████ and Wolheim worked and the film managed to be quite entertaining.
RamRao	training	Harold Lloyd	Oddly, however, the film managed to beat out ████████████  film, SPEEDY, for an Oscar for Best Direction for a Comedy (a category no longer used)--as SPEEDY was a superior film in most ways (it  one of Lloyd  best films).
RamRao	training	Louis Walheim	 By the way, director Milestone and █████████████ would team up just a few years later for another WWI picture, the great ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT--a film that is definitely NOT a comedy.
RamRao	training	Simon Cowell	Created by ████████████ of American Idol fame, AGT is a talent search show which is similar in format to American Idol and the Gong Show.
RamRao	training	Mr. Koji	Since this movie is an adaptation of ████████ Suzuki  Lemonheart which is among the 3 stories contained in Ringu 0: Baasudei that was released in 1999, it  sufficient say that the director did pretty well with altering some of its contents to suit the interpretation of the previous movies (Ringu and Ringu 2) which was also unparalleled.
RamRao	training	Sadako	I don't think the storyline was confusing at all since it mostly concentrated on ██████  life (Derived from Lemonheart) and doesn't really focus on the curse of the video tape.
RamRao	training	Sadako	 What I truly love about this movie is the fact that they wanted us to feel sympathetic towards ██████  character albeit the wickedness of what we see in Ringu and Ringu 2.
RamRao	training	Yukie Nakama	Bravo to ████████████ for portraying Sadako  character effectively.
RamRao	training	Sadako	It  designed to tell us the tragic story of ██████  life before the cursed video tape, which exceeded from my own expectations.
RamRao	training	Nakata Hideo	 I can see why many are baffled by the story since the one who directed this is not ████████████ and obviously lingered a bit from the previous adaptations (I guess you might say more on the book than Ringu and Ringu 2.).
RamRao	training	Katharine	He meets a female fighter, █████████, who appears to be homeless but who can fight and defeat men twice her size.
RamRao	training	Dublin	The two eventually team up, but ██████  somewhat sleazy past catches up with them, causing conflict, pain, and emotional distress for both.
RamRao	training	Nick Nolte	 Perhaps ██████████  worst role EVER.
RamRao	training	Josh Brolin	Ewan McGregor just looks embarrassed, as do ███████████ and Patricia Arquette.
RamRao	training	Simon	█████ Cowell manages to try another spin-off of "American Idol", despite of the failure with his previous attempt "American Inventor".
RamRao	training	Cowell	Even more, giving it is an open talent contest, half of them are singers what gives ██████ a chance for a shot closer to the "Idol" success.
RamRao	training	Philbin	 Regis ███████ does his job, he always manages to look as a nice guy, I don't think he contributes rising the show interest but is not responsible for the poor overcome either.
RamRao	validation	David Hasselhoff	 Let me start by ████████████████ just because he is the only I know.
RamRao	validation	Piers Morgan	 ████████████, who I don't have any clue who he is, takes the role of the wise and balanced judge completing his stereotype with a British accent that in America seems -wrongfully- to be synonymous of a higher intellect.
RamRao	validation	Brandy	 Finally ██████.
RamRao	validation	Brandy	At some point I felt bad for Morgan whose face seems ██████ preferred target for the uncontrollable spin of her arms and her annoying affection demonstrations.
RamRao	validation	Cowell	 In his modesty ██████ doesn't realize that the success of his shows is linked to him being in front the cameras rather than behind them.
RamRao	validation	Simon	If █████ were in this show not even the contestants would be necessary to nail its success.
RamRao	validation	Young Sadako	████████████ is part of a theater troupe, and a reporter knows who she is but the rest of the cast doesn't, at least, not yet.
RamRao	validation	Sadako	There are glimpses of ██████  strange powers, which she can't seem to control when she  threatened.
RamRao	validation	Sadako	██████ then ends up with the leading role in the play but when the meddling reporter slips a tape in that isn't meant to be part of the play, it changes everything and ██████  telekinetic powers are unleashed on the unsuspecting audience and cast, but stopped just short of harm to anyone....except, herself.
RamRao	validation	Ringu	 Just a warning though; it is slow paced, even more so than █████, a complaint many people seem to have with these movies, and the first time i watched it i wasn't sure if it was leading anywhere.
RamRao	validation	Sadako	██████ Yamamura is part of an acting school, and her first role is a few days away.
RamRao	validation	Sadako	The story also follows a journalist who has traced down ██████, she is the widow of a man who died, also under mysterious circumstances at the hands of, she believes, ██████  estranged mother.
RamRao	validation	Sadako	██████  mother was famed for her supposed supernatural abilities, and killed herself a short while ago.
RamRao	validation	Sadako	The journalist wants to find out the truth, and finds ██████ just before opening night.
RamRao	validation	Sadako	Paying one of the jealous girls to mess with the audio equipment, hoping to get a reaction from ██████, much like Hamlet, the play begins to go wrong, and in a Carrie-like scene, everyone blames ██████.
RamRao	validation	Yukie Nakama	The acting has been very good from everyone, especially ████████████, who is gorgeous, and drags out our sympathy.
RamRao	validation	Sadako	Toyama is the only person who trusts ██████, and tries to defend her, eventually leading to one of the most tragic scenes in movie history.
RamRao	validation	Sadako	Every scene is shot trying to balance beauty with the creation of fear, a wonderful irony considering ██████  own birth and life- She doesn't want to hurt anyone, and is capable of great beauty, but all she seems to do is scare and kill.
RamRao	validation	Sadako	 I've probably hyped the film too much now, but the final scenes in the forest and ██████  old home are really that good.
RamRao	validation	Sadako	The point is, the questions are there to be asked, for us to work them out ourselves- we become like the journalists in each of the movies, drawing ourselves closer into the tragedy and threat of ██████  life until we cannot escape.
RamRao	validation	Mr. Knotts	After his stagecoach is held up, ██████████ joins a wagon train.
RamRao	validation	Barbara Rhoades	He plays horsey with buxom ███████████████ (as Penelope Cushings) and dresses up as a fetching Indian squaw.
RamRao	validation	Knotts	Is ██████' character bisexual?
RamRao	validation	Vic Mizzy	█████████  wild, wild western music resembles his own "Green Acres".
RamRao	validation	Bob Hope	All in all, this is a tedious, uncalled for re-make of ████████  "The Paleface" (1948).
RamRao	validation	Sadako Yamamura	 Where ███████████████ is early in her college experience, and dealing with the typical issues of trying to succeed in her love for theater, and her romantic life.
RamRao	validation	Howard Hughes	Was this an early variation of beefcake courtesy of █████████████?
RamRao	validation	Nestor Almendros	Was the DP trying to emulate the work of ████████████████ on DAYS OF HEAVEN by shooting only ambient lighting?
RamRao	validation	Sadako Yamamura	And in "Ringu 0" (2000), the prequel to the original, we get to see the face of ███████████████, heretofore mostly hidden behind long, stringy hair, and, as played by actress Yukie Nakama, it is quite a lovely face indeed.
RamRao	validation	Sadako	We also get to discover some of ██████  back story, and learn what she was up to 30 years before she began slaying via videotape.
RamRao	testing	Carrie White	Compared to ████████████ in the 1976 film "Carrie," Sadako is far nastier, and just like in that earlier film, all heck breaks loose following an instigated public freakout.
RamRao	testing	Sadako	"Ringu 0" is a fairly slow-moving film, and a surprise revelation concerning ██████ that comes halfway through is very hard to swallow.
RamRao	testing	Sadako Yamamura	Shortly after an oddly quiet young woman, ███████████████ (Yukie Nakama), joins a drama troupe, strange events, including deaths with suspicious circumstances, start occurring.
RamRao	testing	Sadako	Is ██████ somehow connected to these events?
RamRao	testing	Sadako	The horror stuff generally works, although ██████ would have benefited from not having so many functions.
RamRao	testing	Hiroshi Takahashi	 The script, by █████████████████, from a story by Ring novelist Koji Suzuki, is admirable on an artistic level.
RamRao	testing	Norio Tsuruta	 The problem is that director █████████████ just cannot get much momentum going with the material.
RamRao	testing	Sadako	There are glimpses, through ██████ or around her, of a more intriguing world, but they're often little more than "flashes" that might cause us to do a double take.
RamRao	testing	Tsuruta	Takahashi and ███████ work hard to establish a romance subplot involving a love triangle (or two), but this can barely get off the ground.
RamRao	testing	Shoko Miyaji	 I would have preferred a stronger focus on ████████████ (Yoshiko Tanaka), the reporter who is trying to investigate the psychic demonstration tragedy.
nithyasokkula2204	training	Paul	It's a little hard to cope with the fact that the hammerhead shark that's killing everybody is constantly being called "████".
nithyasokkula2204	training	William Forsythe	Also, ████████████████'s cast as a MacGyver-kick-ass-savingtheday- kinda hero lacks credibility.
nithyasokkula2204	training	Paul	On the other hand there are a few hot chicks who make you actually look at the screen while shark ████ bites another one to death.
nithyasokkula2204	training	Charlotte	When █████████ and Veronica get close to intimacy is a beautiful, low key, truly erotic scene.
nithyasokkula2204	training	Veronica	I thought the male actor portraying ████████ was okay but no better than that.
nithyasokkula2204	training	Charlotte	Much better was the woman portraying █████████, a very complex character full of energy, self-loathing, desire and contradictions.
nithyasokkula2204	training	John Cale	Furthermore, both Tak Fujimoto's vibrant cinematography and █████████'s marvelously dolorous oddball blues score are 100% on the money excellent.
nithyasokkula2204	training	Boll	nope ████ just thought to throw it in to upset animal lovers.. whatever.
nithyasokkula2204	training	Linda	Who the puck cares about █████'s 4 part surgery.
nithyasokkula2204	training	Tom Long	I can only assume that he was cast for the role of ████████ on the strength of his excellent acting in "The Choir".
nithyasokkula2204	training	Lebowski	And The Big ████████ was hysterical!
nithyasokkula2204	training	Frederic March	The movie begins well enough, as ██████████████ (a fine actor) is in the lead.
nithyasokkula2204	training	Murry Lerner	I don't know if director ████████████ is just not a Who fan, or worse, for him at least, if he *is* a Who fan and this is all the *eight* cameras could deliver for him.
nithyasokkula2204	training	Lesley	██████ Anne-Down is the lovely leading lady, stumbling upon a lost treasure – it’s actually been hidden away by a local sect to prevent it from falling into the hands of foreigners, who have appropriated much of the country’s heritage (under the pretext of culture) for far too long.
nithyasokkula2204	training	Jessica Stein	Far better than Kissing █████████████, a good choice if your tired of watching gay movies that have some painful lesson and bitter lesson.
nithyasokkula2204	training	James Earl Jones	of State are killed when a building collapses, and the Vice President had had a stroke a month earlier, so the Oval office falls to a token black staffmember (played by ████████████████).
nithyasokkula2204	training	Cheney	This coincidence seems even more plausible today considering recent terrorism and the health of current Vice President ██████.
nithyasokkula2204	training	Wallace	Serling's unsentimental script (based on Irving ███████'s book) includes intrigue and plot twists, and the amazing confluence of recognizable character actors under effective direction transcend the usual TV movie standards, making this one of the better TV movies I've ever seen.
nithyasokkula2204	training	Andy Goldsworthy	It had an overall meditative quality from the music, to the beautiful photography, and listening to the often cliché things about life that ████████████████ would say as he worked or in between shots.
nithyasokkula2204	training	Slasher Cinema	This is truly banal cinema on a Brobdingnagian scale!I have this film on the "██████████████" box-set with some other films.
nithyasokkula2204	training	Craze	From what I can gather, █████ seemed to be about the crazy antiques dealer who prays to an African statue and sacrifices people to it.
nithyasokkula2204	training	Lohan	The casting was well directed and miss █████ does suck you in the movie with her well known attitude and an unsuspected self-cynical humor.
nithyasokkula2204	training	Dan Castellanetta	I remember having a Megavolt action figure, I don't remember what happened to him, but when I found out he was voiced by █████████████████ (Homer Simpson), I really, really wanted that action figure back!
nithyasokkula2204	training	Inman	too clean (and well-fitting, especially her father's old hat and coat in the scene where █████ comes home) for any sense of accuracy.
nithyasokkula2204	training	Elaine	My reaction to that one was the same as ██████'s on Seinfeld: "It sucked.
nithyasokkula2204	training	Orfevres	Quai des ████████ is all of these, but more than anything else it's an amusing comedy of infidelity, jealousy and love, set in post-WWII Paris.
nithyasokkula2204	training	Hitchcock	In this I share █████████'s view, which says, 'A murder mystery is a slice of cake with raisins and candied fruit, and if you deny yourself this, you might as well film a documentary.'"
nithyasokkula2204	training	Orfevres	Quai des ████████ is a wonderful film, and it's no documentary.
nithyasokkula2204	training	Jenny Latour	Her stage name is ████████████.
nithyasokkula2204	training	Martineau	█████████ is something of a sad sack.
nithyasokkula2204	training	Rita Hayworth	She's blond, gorgeous (think of █████████████) and capable.
nithyasokkula2204	training	Martineau	She and █████████ have been friends since they were children together.
nithyasokkula2204	training	Antoine	Inspector ███████ gets the case.
nithyasokkula2204	training	Louis Jouvet	Antoine (████████████) is a tall, tired, middle-aged bachelor with sore feet.
nithyasokkula2204	training	Antoine	One of the first things ███████ discovers is not only did someone brain Brignon with a bottle, someone shot him in the heart.
nithyasokkula2204	training	Jenny Latour	Will we have a chance to see some great music hall songs sung by ████████████?
nithyasokkula2204	training	Detective Antoine	Everything becomes clear, but only with time and █████████████████'s persistence.
nithyasokkula2204	training	Jenny Latour	Most of all, he takes us to the music hall where ████████████ often performs.
nithyasokkula2204	training	Jenny	We can see █████ as she sings, with couples in the seats and single men wearing their coats and hats in standing room.
nithyasokkula2204	training	Jouvet	██████ was tall with a long face and broad cheekbones.
nithyasokkula2204	training	Miss Dora Monnier	At one point he says, "I've taken a liking to you, █████████████████."
nithyasokkula2204	training	Ally McBeal	Jouvet brings all kinds of nuances to that line, from rueful regret to a gentle amusement.True, the idea for this TV series may have sprung from the immense success which ███████████ is enjoying worldwide, even here in Germany.
nithyasokkula2204	training	Rebecca Immanuel	), played by charming ████████████████, exchange quick romantic repartees and continually spy on each other while engaging in sitcom-like criminal cases in Berlin and surroundings.
nithyasokkula2204	training	Isabel Tuengerthal	Further, they are aided by a magnificent cast of co-stars, most notably their secretary, played by ██████████████████, who is a rare gem with GREAT comic potential.
nithyasokkula2204	training	Jim Carrey	I saw the cover, and figured, "Oh, it's got ██████████, it must be at least marginally funny."
nithyasokkula2204	training	Rick Marshall	Will Ferrel plays █████████████, a scientist who believe tachyons, or sub-atomic particles, can cross time and dimension rifts.
nithyasokkula2204	training	Jim Carrey	Not only is ██████████ (or anyone else in this movie) not even remotely funny, but he's not even the main character.
nithyasokkula2204	training	Myrick	Still, it seems that ██████ had enough time on his hands to hatch a few cinematic eggs.
nithyasokkula2204	training	Brad Silberling	The script itself, along with ███████████████'s direction is the trump card, though.
nithyasokkula2204	training	David Vaughn	Subsequently, ████████████ and his partner Victor are abducted by a bunch of weirdos who take them inside an old bunker where their fellow cult members reside.
nithyasokkula2204	validation	Victor	A lot of hokey acting is involved in that process and finally culminates in a scene where ██████ gets to bang a hot cult member chick.
nithyasokkula2204	training	Craig Sheffer	For one, █████████████ is not a likable hero.
nithyasokkula2204	validation	Wilfred Brimley	And, unlike other reviewers, I don't find ███████████████'s narration annoying or distracting.
nithyasokkula2204	validation	Melissa Joan Hart	But the acting is amazing and █████████████████ is as cute as a button.
nithyasokkula2204	validation	Salem	Harvey and Sabrina make a really cute couple and █████ is absolutely hilarious.
nithyasokkula2204	validation	John Millius	He hasn't quite achieved true greatness yet, but one day he may just break through.On the 99th anniversary of the Spanish American war and the most famous land battle of that brief said war, ████████████ wrote and directed a stirring tribute to the First Volunteer Cavalry.
nithyasokkula2204	validation	Morgan	I'm not really a fan of some of the seventh season twists... Once you get to college, ██████ joins the group and her dialog is painful and very poorly acted... Plus she is ugly, so the jokes about how she is only surviving off her good looks were lost on me...
nithyasokkula2204	validation	Ito Misaki	Soon, it seems that a lot of countries are reluctant to accept any more due to the sudden influx of Japanese in their country and the chaos that follows (if this ever happens, touch-wood, I hope ██████████ will be safe... she can always stay at my place... hee hee).
nithyasokkula2204	validation	Toyokawa Etsushi	Dr.Tadokoro (played by ████████████████) was done really well, portraying a divorced and often mad scientist who kicks and bashes up stuff.
nithyasokkula2204	validation	Shibasaki Kou	Reiko (played by gorgeous █████████████) was also played rather well, and has the most memorable line in the entire movie (go watch it to find out) and I fancy that she has a nice acting voice.
nithyasokkula2204	validation	Captain Wentworth	They had poor Anne chasing up and down the streets after █████████████████ like a silly modern adolescent (and if you happen to be a silly modern adolescent reading this, let me tell you: running after a male like a female in heat is NOT cool).
nithyasokkula2204	validation	Roosevelt	Some may find █████████ too super-patriotic, even too racist in some regards.
nithyasokkula2204	validation	Jon Fedele	This time, it is painfully obvious Morty is a man (actor ██████████) in a fake looking suit.
nithyasokkula2204	validation	Vampiros Lesbos	Franco is best known (although 'known' might be slightly exaggerated) for "███████████████", a weird cultish movie that got more acclaim in the mid 90's when people found out Jess Franco was also an interesting composer.
nithyasokkula2204	validation	Franco	Since that moment ██████ never could grip me that much.
nithyasokkula2204	validation	Vampiros Lesbos	It is even better than "███████████████", I think.
nithyasokkula2204	validation	Vampiros Lesbos	Remember, I had seen "███████████████" before (although chronologically that came only three years later) and both movies kinda start the same.
nithyasokkula2204	validation	Godard	But then the story went on, puzzling and gripping, beautiful camera work and the stuff you would like to see ██████ do if he weren't so occupied with spreading his political messages.
nithyasokkula2204	validation	Marilyn Monroe	She recreated ██████████████'s poses for the magazine and I wanted to see the movie because of it.
nithyasokkula2204	validation	Marilyn	You know him, he's the guy who claimed to have been ███████'s confidant and husband for about a weekend.
nithyasokkula2204	validation	Miss Monroe	All his claims were never proved as a matter of fact his marriage claim was totally disproven when a check dated at the same time of their wedding and signed by ███████████ proved that she was in Los Angeles at the time.
nithyasokkula2204	validation	Fu Manchu	For example, there is the scene where █████████ is confused which henchman is which in which he says "Ah, you all look the same to me."
nithyasokkula2204	validation	Mencia	Otherwise, you're better off settling on chewing aluminum foil.Carlos ██████ is not funny.
nithyasokkula2204	validation	Carlos Mencia	From his stand up specials to this train wreck of a TV series, █████████████ is not funny.
nithyasokkula2204	validation	Ashton Kutcher	I would liked that the protagonist male character were given to ██████████████, however, the film is good.Oh my GOD this was so bad!
nithyasokkula2204	validation	Carlos Mencia	Comedy stands no chance of evolving with █████████████ around.
nithyasokkula2204	validation	Carlos Mencia	Perhaps people, especially viewers and Comedy Central executives will get the point since this week's issue of "New York" magazine accurately labeled him: "█████████████, unrepentant joke-filcher.
nithyasokkula2204	validation	Daffy	The short starts with █████ getting frustrated at only being typecast in comedy, and reads HIS version of the classic to the producer.
nithyasokkula2204	validation	Errol Flynn	The rest is a roller-coaster of priceless performances from the toons, swashbuckling and sight gags complete with references to ███████████, with an unexpected ending to boot.
nithyasokkula2204	validation	Sylvester	Porky is given little to do but does what he can with The Lord High Chamberlain, while █████████ relishes his part as the Duke.
nithyasokkula2204	testing	Melissa	Also ███████ is a very beautiful and cute duck I think.
nithyasokkula2204	testing	Clancy B. Grass	The direction, music, and print color are very good as well as the opening theme song performed by ███████████████, III.
nithyasokkula2204	testing	Marine Corp	is as accurate a portrayal to date depicting ███████████ boot camp and how boys are turned into men.
nithyasokkula2204	testing	Jack	████ Webb is excellent as Sgt.Jim Moore, a tough, but fair drill instructor in Paris Island North Carolina.
nithyasokkula2204	testing	Full Metal Jacket	A more recent film, █████████████████, also shows life in basic training and is well worth viewing.Nothing will ruin a movie as much as the combination of a poor script and poor direction.
nithyasokkula2204	testing	Ricci	Christina █████, always watchable, is given little in the script to support her nutty character.
nithyasokkula2204	testing	Tarantino	█████████ took old action movies from the seventies and copied everything about them.
nithyasokkula2204	testing	Kill Bill	More than that, I was offended that I was led to believe that I was going to see an actually good movie, which █████████ is not.I couldn't bear to sit through he entire movie.
nithyasokkula2204	testing	Amitabh Bachchan	But what makes 'Eklavya' a tad different is just one name  ████████████████.
nithyasokkula2204	testing	Linda Carter	The main draw to this one was to see ████████████ (Wonder Woman) out of that curve hugging outfit with her chest free to grace the screen.
