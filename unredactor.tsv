cegme	training	ashton kutcher	"I couldn't image ██████████████ in a serious role, but his performance truly"								
SarahBrown	training	Ashton Kutcher	I'll admit that I was reluctant to see it because from what I knew of ██████████████ he was only able to do comedy.								
SarahBrown	training	Noonan	The acting is all up to ██████ and he carries his thankless character perfectly.								
SarahBrown	training	Picasso	███████ was a finer draftsman and a brilliant artist at that age than many artists will ever become in a lifetime.								
SarahBrown	training	Tom Noonan	"The incredible performance by ██████████ is brilliant and provocative and the editing, sound design, cinematography and directing are truly inspired."								
SarahBrown	training	Shabana Azmi	 Her Excellency Madam ████████████ has worked in countless movies over life time.								
SarahBrown	training	Mehta	"These two genres (i.e. deep meaningful alternative-love story and comic satire) usually mix together just as well as oil and water do, but █████ (somehow) manages to achieve the balance to near perfection."								
SarahBrown	training	Mehta	"While developing her primary subject matter, █████ manages to achieve this secondary theme skillfully."								
SarahBrown	training	Ram	"As legend goes, ███ subjugates his wife by making her walk through a Fire to prove her `purity.'"								
SarahBrown	training	Sita	"████, in response, cries and leaves him, reuniting with her mother(the Earth)."								
SarahBrown	training	Ms Mehta	"I guess the fact that so many women applauded ████████'s work, was because it provided them with an option to think for themselves."								
SarahBrown	training	Ms Mehta	Bravo to ████████ in translating her vision so clearly.								
SarahBrown	training	Radha	I especially like the flashbacks to the young █████ trying to 'see' for the ocean.								
SarahBrown	training	A.R. Rahman	The movie is beautifully filmed and enhanced by the musical score by ███████████.								
SarahBrown	training	Ashton Kutcher	██████████████ can act!								
SarahBrown	training	Deepa Mehta's	"█████████████ ""Fire"" is groundbreaking, bold, and artistic."								
SarahBrown	training	A.R. Rahman's	█████████████ music is the work of the genius and almost plays the role of another character in the film.								
SarahBrown	training	Deepa Mehta	"'Water' (2005), the final part of Toronto-based Indian film-director ███████████'s elemental trilogy has been finally completed, almost ten years after the release of the very first controversial element, 'Fire' (1996), which was followed with a slightly lesser controversial sequel '1947: Earth' (1998)."								
SarahBrown	training	Deepa Mehta	"International fame followed ███████████ in 1996 with the release of the controversial 'Fire', which spread with rage among the false patriotic consciousness existing Indian extremist."								
SarahBrown	training	Camilla	"Having already explored friendship between two women in '███████', in 'Fire' Mehta went a step further to portray a more intimate relationship between two lonely neglected women."								
SarahBrown	training	Kulbhushan Kharbanda	"Set in modern day India, the suburbs of the capital city of New Delhi, it shows two brothers and their wives, the elder brother (████████████████████) having joined a weird Hindu sect leads a life of celibacy, faithful to his guru of sexless existence."								
SarahBrown	training	Deepa Mehta's	" Two years later, █████████████ second installment was the element of mother earth, released in India by the name of '1947: Earth',yet another excellent movie by a great director, this time in the Hindi language, unlike 'Fire', which was made in the English language."								
SarahBrown	training	Deepa Mehta	" Now ███████████ has managed to complete the trilogy, despite a lot of problems, having released the final installment recently, 'Water'."								
SarahBrown	training	Nandita Das	The scene where ███████████ loses her virginity to her husband certainly was the first of its kind in Indian cinemas.								
SarahBrown	training	Nandita Das	Good acting by all the actors especially ███████████ amidst criticism from the Indian public								
SarahBrown	training	Deepa Mehta	I admire ███████████ and this movie is a masterpiece.								
SarahBrown	training	Sita	████ still cared enough for him to find that moment to let him know that he is not responsible for her deviant outlet to her blocked desires.								
SarahBrown	training	Sita	 But the final act of rejection was by the grandmother - she could not break free from her rusted mindset to accept ████'s desire.								
SarahBrown	training	Mehta	"I finally watched the third film in █████'s trilogy: ""Fire""."								
SarahBrown	training	Mehta	" █████ is one brave lady: she sees with a clear eye much that is jaundiced, false and repressive about the great society from which she came from."								
SarahBrown	training	Mehta	"Worse, if someone like █████ has the courage to hold up a mirror to these issues, she faces death threats."								
SarahBrown	training	Mehta	█████ is clearly impatient with the totally rigid religious attitudes that either keep widows in misery (Water) or else keep women enslaved to loveless marriages (Fire).								
SarahBrown	training	Mehta	"In any case █████'s film is a very moving, powerful attempt at sexual discourse that holds modern Indian relationships up to probing scrutiny."								
SarahBrown	training	Mehta	█████ is forcing the issues to be looked at no matter how much flack.								
SarahBrown	training	Superb	"██████, disturbing, provocative, taboo shattering."								
SarahBrown	training	Kevin Costner	"The trailers looked good, but the water theme was giving me bad flashbacks to the last █████████████ movie that dealt with the subject - Waterworld."								
SarahBrown	training	Ashton Kutcher	"Plus, despite the promise ██████████████ showed in The Butterfly Effect, I'm still not completely sold on him."								
SarahBrown	training	Kenny Rogers'	"The movie immediately throws us into the midst of a tense rescue mission, and I was gripped tighter than █████████████ orange face lift."								
SarahBrown	training	George Clooney	"Sunglasses, a tough guy toothpick in his mouth, and sportin' a smirk that'd make ██████████████ proud█"								
SarahBrown	training	Costner	"I had a bad feeling that the pace would slow too much when ███████ started training the young guys, but on the contrary, the training sessions just might be the most interesting aspect of the film."								
SarahBrown	training	Deepa Mehta's	"█████████████ somewhat mis-titled FIRE is the first of a loosely connected trilogy, here linked by the theme of the elements, and more symbolic than consuming."								
SarahBrown	training	Sita	"One husband married a vivacious young woman, ████, out of family obligation."								
SarahBrown	training	Sita	This arranged marriage is uncomfortable for them both but in the beginning ████ makes an attempt to connect with her sullen husband.								
SarahBrown	training	Sita	"However, he sees himself as a victim and could have cared less about ████--and he continues to have an affair with a liberal-minded Chinese lady."								
SarahBrown	training	Sita	"In their dead marriage, sex was purely meant to produce children and there was no way ████ could have any of her sexual or emotional needs met."								
SarahBrown	training	Deepa Mehta	"By the way, director ███████████ (a popular female director) has made several other wonderful films such as EARTH and BOLLYWOOD/Hollywood."								
SarahBrown	training	Deepa Mehta	This is my first ███████████ film.								
SarahBrown	training	Mehta	"█████'s film of two bisexual ladies in an Indian middle-class household may be sacrilege to some, but merely captures the atrophy of middle-class homes that does not seem to aspire for something better than its immediate survival in a limited social space."								
SarahBrown	training	Claudio Carvalho	Previous reviewer ████████████████ gave a much better recap of the film's plot details than I could.								
SarahBrown	training	William Faulkner's	"This intelligent, moving and beautiful film is a study in the ways people react to tradition (reminds me of ██████████████████ novels)."								
SarahBrown	training	Ashton	I am happy to say that ██████ is great in this part.								
SarahBrown	validation	Ben Randall	"However, the use of humor, the exploration of the toughness of the training and the fun of watching ███████████ ""do his own thing as a trainer"", kept me riveted and thoroughly entertained."								
SarahBrown	validation	Shabana Azmi	"To my mind, the very character played by ████████████ is a symbol of the Indian feminine protest against the Indian society."								
SarahBrown	validation	Nandita Das	"I was impressed with ███████████, who was quite attractive, and played her character with total earnestness."								
SarahBrown	validation	Shabana Azmi	"But I was even more impressed with ████████████, who I understand is a long-time fixture of Bollywood."								
SarahBrown	validation	Oldboy	"Besides the apparent connections with ""██████"" (and Park-wook's other films), an incestuous relation in this one really disturbed me, and also the subtle erotic theme that hung around all the vampiric, physical action."								
SarahBrown	validation	Stanley Kubrick	"Park-wook has really, really mastered his cinematography in this film, and owes a lot to ███████████████; there are a whole lot of beautiful shots strewn throughout the film, some for simple effects and some that require several glances and probably repeated views to fully catch."								
SarahBrown	validation	Chan-wook Park's	████████████████ new film is a complex film that is not easy to classify.								
SarahBrown	validation	Emile Zola's	"The film takes its own matters and mixes them with classic European literature, in this case ████████████ ""Thérèse Raquin""."								
SarahBrown	validation	Chan-wook Park's	"Although I've never seen the film, I couldn't help but feel like this was ████████████████ version of Twilight."								
SarahBrown	validation	Park	"The psychological aspect that I love about ████'s previous films is in Thirst, as well."								
SarahBrown	validation	Chan-wook Park	"██████████████ bites into the vampire mythology with Thirst and puts his own dark, psychological twist on it."								
SarahBrown	validation	Park Chan-wook	"Anything ██████████████ creates is guaranteed to be unique, brilliant, and very twisted at a minimum."								
SarahBrown	validation	Park Chan-wook	As negative as it may sound the positives definitely outweigh the negatives and another volume has without a doubt been added to the dark and twisted Zeitgeist of ██████████████ film.								
SarahBrown	validation	Bakjwi	"That was not the case when I watched ██████, under the American title Thirst."								
SarahBrown	validation	Bakjwi	 There aren't many negatives I can say about ██████.								
SarahBrown	validation	Dracula	"""bakjwi"" literally means bat in korean and we all know that in many classic vampire stories, you see count ███████ or vampires turning into a bat and fly away or wuheva."								
SarahBrown	validation	aesop	"Duality of human nature = if you ever read █████'s fables, there is this one fable where mammals and birds are fighting and a bat just can't seem to take a side and it tries to play both sides to his advantage."								
SarahBrown	validation	Chan-wook Park	██████████████ is a master of cinematography and this movie is no exception.								
SarahBrown	validation	Chan-wook Park	"██████████████ is no stranger to controversy as we know, and this film touches on taboo almost as much as oldboy."								
SarahBrown	validation	Hyeon	"Instead of legitimately dying, █████ becomes a vampire, always yearning for the sustenance blood gives for him to fight off an infectious disease which returns causing the symptoms which flat-lined him to begin with(..bumps/sores, and the body vomits blood)."								
SarahBrown	validation	Hyeon	"Sunlight, as is known in the vampire genre, causes torturous death if exposed to █████ for a length of time."								
SarahBrown	validation	Hyeon	"In doing so, █████ has created a monster."								
SarahBrown	validation	Park Chan-Wook	██████████████ throws that concept completely out the window and shows directly what he wants--and what he wants to show is pretty much anything he can think of.								
SarahBrown	validation	Park	"Leaving it to the actors and dialog to create subtlety, from a stylistic perspective ████ seems willing to do just about anything to get his point across."								
SarahBrown	validation	Chan-Wook	"█████████ adds some much needed humour into the film, but this is only realised in the final third of the movie."								
SarahBrown	validation	Park Chun-wook's	"'Thirst' is original, entertaining and fortunately a little less weird than ████████████████ earlier endeavors."								
SarahBrown	validation	Chan-wook Park	"██████████████, you have to hand it to the guy."								
SarahBrown	validation	Clancy Brown	"Co-star ████████████ (HBO's ""Carnivale"" - great to see him again) played the captain of the Coast Guard's Kodiak, Alaska base in a strong, convincing role as a leader with the prerequisite and necessary ice water in his veins."								
SarahBrown	validation	Sang	"There's nothing terribly weepy or insipid with the story and characters at any point, and the implications put forth from religion early on (████, for example, is seen as a healer of sorts since he rose from the dead thanks to his vampirism, even as he just can't be that and knows it) on top of those about good vs evil, push it up into another plane cinematically."								
SarahBrown	validation	Chan-wook Park	"Korean cinema has the ability to turn genres on its head, and the latest by the celebrated director ██████████████ is a tale of a good pious priest who becomes a vampire."								
SarahBrown	testing	Kevin Costner	"The mentor this time is played perfectly by █████████████; An ordinary man with common everyday problems who lives an extraordinary conviction, to save lives."								
SarahBrown	testing	Costner	"While his scenes with the local love interest are a tad stiff and don't generate enough heat to melt butter, he compliments ███████ well."								
SarahBrown	testing	Leonard Maltin	"Well, I have to disagree with ██████████████ on this animated short."								
SarahBrown	testing	Bob McKimson	Director ████████████ offers endless laughters by means of absurd and unexpected demonstrative humour.								
SarahBrown	testing	Maria Von Trapp	"It will be the death of ███████████████"" Fascinating study on changing an image."								
SarahBrown	testing	Julie	"█████ is beautiful and uses her many talents, throughout the film."								
SarahBrown	testing	Julie Andrews	"Fun, entertaining movie about WWII German spy (█████████████!)"								
SarahBrown	testing	Rosie Perez	Had to do a double take when I saw that was ███████████ there.								
SarahBrown	testing	Merkerson	"But, overall a great film with a truly outstanding performance by █████████."								
SarahBrown	testing	Ruben Santiago Hudson	"Of course, none of this would have been possible if █████████████████████ hadn't written his wonderful play."								
usma92	training	Rickman	"She was a rebel in fact, and never fully matured for her husband, a lawyer (███████)."								
usma92	training	Marilyn	When he did ███████ impersonation that should have told the wife everything.								
usma92	training	Jack Frost	"██████████ 2, is probably the most cheesiest movie I have ever seen in my life."								
usma92	training	Chris Cooper	This film was my first acquaintance with the talents of ████████████.								
usma92	training	Tim Curry	"In fact the only really bad performance in the film was from █████████, who is supposed to be the name."								
usma92	training	Matthew Rhys	"████████████ performance of the stupid boy coming to big London and sudden taking drugs from people he does noteven know does not seem very credible,"								
usma92	training	Chris Cooper	The film boasts an incredible performance from ████████████ who shows an amazing versatility in the exploration of his role.								
usma92	training	Patricia Clarkson	█████████████████ is equally as stellar and realistic in a role that many actresses would crumble in.								
usma92	training	Tim Curry	and of course █████████ who's eloquent drug land boss is convincing.								
usma92	training	Jason Donovan	"although █████████████ in particular for me stands out (he was playing Frank N Furter in The Rocky Horror Show in London at roughly the time this must have been filming,"								
usma92	training	Terry Scott	"███████████ was a comic genius, as he well proved in productions such as 'Hugh & I',"								
usma92	training	June Whitfield	██████████████ likewise was a comedy legend in her own right.								
usma92	training	Elenor Parker	The dialog is fast and very witty.█████████████ at her physical peak 								
usma92	training	Flynn	You will be surprised at █████'s comedy timing.								
usma92	training	Marnie	Watch it!!! love ██████								
usma92	training	Aeris	Plus the way █████ comes to help Cloud at many different times in the movie.								
usma92	training	Tyler Sheena	████████████ i hope you can email me back if you have any details if there is another one .								
usma92	training	Jenova	but it just seemed cheesy after all the explanation about how the bad guys needed to collect all of those who had ██████ cells								
usma92	training	Cait Sith	"All your favorite characters are there, even █████████."								
usma92	training	Cait Sith	"█████████ sounds less cute than I imagined, but worked very well."								
usma92	training	Tifa	"Cloud sounds tough and broody, ████ sounds kind yet strong..."								
usma92	training	Aeris	"█████ is also perfect, she sounds exactly as I imagined."								
usma92	training	Jason Alexander	The show stars ███████████████ of Seinfeld fame								
usma92	training	Tim Curry	and also █████████ of Rocky Horror Picture Show and It fame								
usma92	training	Nobuo	█████ isn't the best at writing music to go along with action								
usma92	training	Marlene	"at least I think it was ██████████sounded like her) gives a bit of background at the beginning,"								
usma92	training	Duckman	Though none of them are as deranged as ███████.								
usma92	training	Jason Alexander	(voiced by the maniacal ███████████████)								
usma92	training	David Boreanaz	I especially loved ██████████████ stretching in a part so unlike anything else he played proving once again his amazing gift for comedy.								
usma92	training	Caroline Dhavernas	I read the brief synopsis and was unimpressed but as I watched it (mainly for ██████████████████)								
usma92	training	David Boreanaz	The male characters in the movie were brilliant - ██████████████ was great as the fickle hunk								
usma92	training	David Boreanaz	██████████████ gives a wonderful performance as the adult male who clearly gets himself into more trouble than he can handle.								
usma92	training	John Hazlett	This information was actually confirmed by the director himself ████████████ at the Q&A after the film.								
usma92	training	John Hazlett	I had the pleasure of meeting ████████████ tonight who seemed like a very nice guy and was very appreciative of the comments made about the film.								
usma92	training	Keith Clark	But this summer is going to be a special one as they all blackmail ███████████ 								
usma92	training	Caroline Dhavernas	(██████████████████) is the ringleader who basically doesn't know what to do with her life after High School								
usma92	training	Thomas Jane	"It had been a while since i seen it, but it does feature ███████████ in the first role i seen him in."								
usma92	training	Paulina Porizkova	"█████████████████ is dressed as a cheerleader type, looking very fresh and hot."								
usma92	training	Tom Selleck	"Sexy and lethal, like in the one movie with ███████████, but with a never seen before malevolence."								
usma92	training	Aaron Eckhart	I stumbled onto it at the video store and rented it because █████████████								
usma92	training	Mickey Rourke	For you █████████████ fans...								
usma92	training	Bock	"I said 'no ████ don't do it. You're a doctor, a healer, you're a necessary person, you're life is meaningful'."								
usma92	training	George C. Scott	Black comedy features a 'tour-de-force' performance from veteran actor ███████████████								
usma92	training	Scott	"Hospital is as black of a comedy as ""Network"" is, and the excellent cast, led by the incomparable █████, does his work full justice."								
usma92	training	Pepe Le Pew	"This short, a formative cartoon featuring ███████████ , concerns a cat who thinks he'll solve all his problems by pretending to be a skunk."								
usma92	training	Betty Boop	"After all, ██████████ was in part responsible for the Production Code coming into existance."								
usma92	training	Aihara	"██████, an aloof girl, will definitely make the viewers ponder who IS behind the aloof girl."								
usma92	training	Yoshida	Does she love ████████								
usma92	training	Ito	Or does she love ████								
usma92	training	Alastair Sim	"This film is funny, having great sight gags and ████████████ is great."								
usma92	validation	Bill Paxton	"Actor turned director ███████████ follows up his promising debut, the Gothic-horror ""Frailty"", with this family friendly sports drama about the 1913 U.S. Open"								
usma92	validation	Harry Vardon	"The movie depicted well the psychological battles that ████████████ fought within himself,"								
usma92	validation	Shia Lebouf	I didn't realize how charming ███████████ could be.								
usma92	validation	Josh Flitter	And ████████████ as the ten year old caddy threatens to steal every scene in which he appears.								
usma92	validation	Stephen Dillane	"███████████████ is excellent as usual,"								
usma92	validation	Francis	"But despite these handicaps, ███████ displays courage, spirit, heroism, and humility at this world class event."								
usma92	validation	Hongsheng	"Maybe I'm reading into this too much, but I wonder how much of a hand █████████ had in developing the film."								
usma92	validation	Jia Hongsheng	I found the █████████████ story interesting.								
usma92	validation	Lennon	"Like ██████, he has gained success without a loss of identity."								
usma92	validation	John Lennon	His devotion to The Beatles and ███████████ is a great metaphor for his life and the helplessness he feels.								
usma92	validation	Custer	The film chronicles ██████ from the moment that he arrives at West Point Academy until the Indians massacre him at the Little Big Horn.								
usma92	validation	Sheridan	"Indeed, ████████ was a lieutenant at this point."								
usma92	validation	Moreland	So much so that in one scene it looked like it might have been ████████ hamming it up in a dress.								
usma92	validation	Mickael Curtiz	"After working on 7 movies with director ██████████████ (The Adventures of Robin Hood are their best achievement),"								
usma92	validation	Bette Davis	"This is worth stressing, as he was often derided as an actor by ███████████ et al."								
usma92	validation	Spencer Tracy	much better than the much vaunted █████████████ or many other stars could have done.								
usma92	validation	Anthony Quinn	the young █████████████ getting a start as Crazy Horse								
usma92	validation	Madonna	"Plus, the acting was great, and ███████ is my idol and she did a phat job!"								
usma92	validation	Griffin Dunne	"█████████████ plays the hapless future groom/puppet who is sent to escort her from prison to the bus station, where a series of unfortunate events occurs, thus creating the plot."								
usma92	validation	Mozart	"So this movie is to ""The Godfather"" as new wave music is to ██████."								
usma92	validation	Joe Estevez	"███████████ may not have his brothers career, but does a good job of bringing focus to the story"								
usma92	validation	Ed Harris	And █████████ will win for BEST SUPPORTING ACTOR.								
usma92	validation	Cuba Gooding	"Then there is a black retarded frightened but pleasant fellow, ████████████,"								
usma92	validation	Stewart	The rest of the film is a puzzle as ███████ tries to save them and solve the mystery.								
usma92	validation	Albert Hall	The final scene takes place in ███████████ and is one of the most famous in film which lasts for 12 minutes with no dialog.								
usma92	validation	Alfred Hitchcock	████████████████ shall always remain over the top of any directors of his time.								
usma92	validation	Truffaut	"████████ argued that the earlier version of ""The Man Who Knew Too Much"" lacked the depth of the later version."								
usma92	validation	Reggie Malder	"The casting of character actor █████████████ as the assassin, is brilliant."								
usma92	validation	Max Fleischer	This was another in the series of excellent cartoons █████████████ produced for Paramount Studio.								
usma92	validation	Lois Lane	"With intrepid reporter █████████ as the only passenger on board,"								
usma92	testing	Randolph Scott	"As usual, ██████████████ put in another relaxed and realistic performance."								
usma92	testing	Fritz Lang	"However, for the life of me, I have no idea why ██████████ was assigned to direct this film--after all, he knew nothing about Westerns."								
usma92	testing	Dean Jagger	"While nice guy ███████████ (sporting lots of hair) did his best to get this done, there was a bad guy just waiting to undo this for his own selfish reasons."								
usma92	testing	Clive Barker	"████████████, the man who brought ""Hellraiser"", makes a horror movie that is part-Goth, part-Mythology, and all horror in-between."								
usma92	testing	Danny Elfman	"The ████████████ composed score is as good as it gets, and is among his best work."								
usma92	testing	Doug Bradley	"The rest of the cast, which includes ████████████ is very good, save for the ridiculously over the top redneck sheriff."								
usma92	testing	David Cronenberg	"I love this movie, even though, as many of the reviewers have noted, the expressions of the actors (with the exception of ████████████████, who does a wonderful appearance) are rather tacky."								
usma92	testing	Vincent D'Onofrio	"On the outside, this film is better because of █████████████████ (Law & Order: Criminal Intent), but this film is equally as good as the 1982 version."								
usma92	testing	Shemp	One of My favorite Stooges shorts with █████ is none other than Brideless Groom!								
usma92	testing	Curly	I prescribe 'Brideless Groom' as medicine for anyone who thinks the Stooges' glory years ended when █████ left.
