cegme	training	ashton kutcher	I couldn't image ██████████████ in a serious role, but his performance truly
SarahBrown	training	Ashton Kutcher	I'll admit that I was reluctant to see it because from what I knew of ██████████████ he was only able to do comedy.
SarahBrown	training	Noonan	The acting is all up to ██████ and he carries his thankless character perfectly.
SarahBrown	training	Picasso	███████ was a finer draftsman and a brilliant artist at that age than many artists will ever become in a lifetime.
SarahBrown	training	Tom Noonan	The incredible performance by ██████████ is brilliant and provocative and the editing, sound design, cinematography and directing are truly inspired.
SarahBrown	training	Shabana Azmi	 Her Excellency Madam ████████████ has worked in countless movies over life time.
SarahBrown	training	Mehta	These two genres (i.e. deep meaningful alternative-love story and comic satire) usually mix together just as well as oil and water do, but █████ (somehow) manages to achieve the balance to near perfection.
SarahBrown	training	Mehta	While developing her primary subject matter, █████ manages to achieve this secondary theme skillfully.
SarahBrown	training	Ram	As legend goes, ███ subjugates his wife by making her walk through a Fire to prove her `purity.'
SarahBrown	training	Sita	████, in response, cries and leaves him, reuniting with her mother(the Earth).
SarahBrown	training	Ms Mehta	I guess the fact that so many women applauded ████████'s work, was because it provided them with an option to think for themselves.
SarahBrown	training	Ms Mehta	Bravo to ████████ in translating her vision so clearly.
SarahBrown	training	Radha	I especially like the flashbacks to the young █████ trying to 'see' for the ocean.
SarahBrown	training	A.R. Rahman	The movie is beautifully filmed and enhanced by the musical score by ███████████.
SarahBrown	training	Ashton Kutcher	██████████████ can act!
SarahBrown	training	Deepa Mehta's	"█████████████ ""Fire"" is groundbreaking, bold, and artistic."
SarahBrown	training	A.R. Rahman's	█████████████ music is the work of the genius and almost plays the role of another character in the film.
SarahBrown	training	Deepa Mehta	'Water' (2005), the final part of Toronto-based Indian film-director ███████████'s elemental trilogy has been finally completed, almost ten years after the release of the very first controversial element, 'Fire' (1996), which was followed with a slightly lesser controversial sequel '1947: Earth' (1998).
SarahBrown	training	Deepa Mehta	International fame followed ███████████ in 1996 with the release of the controversial 'Fire', which spread with rage among the false patriotic consciousness existing Indian extremist.
SarahBrown	training	Camilla	Having already explored friendship between two women in '███████', in 'Fire' Mehta went a step further to portray a more intimate relationship between two lonely neglected women.
SarahBrown	training	Kulbhushan Kharbanda	Set in modern day India, the suburbs of the capital city of New Delhi, it shows two brothers and their wives, the elder brother (████████████████████) having joined a weird Hindu sect leads a life of celibacy, faithful to his guru of sexless existence.
SarahBrown	training	Deepa Mehta's	 Two years later, █████████████ second installment was the element of mother earth, released in India by the name of '1947: Earth',yet another excellent movie by a great director, this time in the Hindi language, unlike 'Fire', which was made in the English language.
SarahBrown	training	Deepa Mehta	 Now ███████████ has managed to complete the trilogy, despite a lot of problems, having released the final installment recently, 'Water'.
SarahBrown	training	Nandita Das	The scene where ███████████ loses her virginity to her husband certainly was the first of its kind in Indian cinemas.
SarahBrown	training	Nandita Das	Good acting by all the actors especially ███████████ amidst criticism from the Indian public
SarahBrown	training	Deepa Mehta	I admire ███████████ and this movie is a masterpiece.
SarahBrown	training	Sita	████ still cared enough for him to find that moment to let him know that he is not responsible for her deviant outlet to her blocked desires.
SarahBrown	training	Sita	 But the final act of rejection was by the grandmother - she could not break free from her rusted mindset to accept ████'s desire.
SarahBrown	training	Mehta	"I finally watched the third film in █████'s trilogy: ""Fire""."
SarahBrown	training	Mehta	 █████ is one brave lady: she sees with a clear eye much that is jaundiced, false and repressive about the great society from which she came from.
SarahBrown	training	Mehta	Worse, if someone like █████ has the courage to hold up a mirror to these issues, she faces death threats.
SarahBrown	training	Mehta	█████ is clearly impatient with the totally rigid religious attitudes that either keep widows in misery (Water) or else keep women enslaved to loveless marriages (Fire).
SarahBrown	training	Mehta	In any case █████'s film is a very moving, powerful attempt at sexual discourse that holds modern Indian relationships up to probing scrutiny.
SarahBrown	training	Mehta	█████ is forcing the issues to be looked at no matter how much flack.
SarahBrown	training	Superb	██████, disturbing, provocative, taboo shattering.
SarahBrown	training	Kevin Costner	The trailers looked good, but the water theme was giving me bad flashbacks to the last █████████████ movie that dealt with the subject - Waterworld.
SarahBrown	training	Ashton Kutcher	Plus, despite the promise ██████████████ showed in The Butterfly Effect, I'm still not completely sold on him.
SarahBrown	training	Kenny Rogers'	The movie immediately throws us into the midst of a tense rescue mission, and I was gripped tighter than █████████████ orange face lift.
SarahBrown	training	George Clooney	Sunglasses, a tough guy toothpick in his mouth, and sportin' a smirk that'd make ██████████████ proud?
SarahBrown	training	Costner	I had a bad feeling that the pace would slow too much when ███████ started training the young guys, but on the contrary, the training sessions just might be the most interesting aspect of the film.
SarahBrown	training	Deepa Mehta's	█████████████ somewhat mis-titled FIRE is the first of a loosely connected trilogy, here linked by the theme of the elements, and more symbolic than consuming.
SarahBrown	training	Sita	One husband married a vivacious young woman, ████, out of family obligation.
SarahBrown	training	Sita	This arranged marriage is uncomfortable for them both but in the beginning ████ makes an attempt to connect with her sullen husband.
SarahBrown	training	Sita	However, he sees himself as a victim and could have cared less about ████--and he continues to have an affair with a liberal-minded Chinese lady.
SarahBrown	training	Sita	In their dead marriage, sex was purely meant to produce children and there was no way ████ could have any of her sexual or emotional needs met.
SarahBrown	training	Deepa Mehta	By the way, director ███████████ (a popular female director) has made several other wonderful films such as EARTH and BOLLYWOOD/Hollywood.
SarahBrown	training	Deepa Mehta	This is my first ███████████ film.
SarahBrown	training	Mehta	█████'s film of two bisexual ladies in an Indian middle-class household may be sacrilege to some, but merely captures the atrophy of middle-class homes that does not seem to aspire for something better than its immediate survival in a limited social space.
SarahBrown	training	Claudio Carvalho	Previous reviewer ████████████████ gave a much better recap of the film's plot details than I could.
SarahBrown	training	William Faulkner's	This intelligent, moving and beautiful film is a study in the ways people react to tradition (reminds me of ██████████████████ novels).
SarahBrown	training	Ashton	I am happy to say that ██████ is great in this part.
SarahBrown	validation	Ben Randall	"However, the use of humor, the exploration of the toughness of the training and the fun of watching ███████████ ""do his own thing as a trainer"", kept me riveted and thoroughly entertained."
SarahBrown	validation	Shabana Azmi	To my mind, the very character played by ████████████ is a symbol of the Indian feminine protest against the Indian society.
SarahBrown	validation	Nandita Das	I was impressed with ███████████, who was quite attractive, and played her character with total earnestness.
SarahBrown	validation	Shabana Azmi	But I was even more impressed with ████████████, who I understand is a long-time fixture of Bollywood.
SarahBrown	validation	Oldboy	"Besides the apparent connections with ""██████"" (and Park-wook's other films), an incestuous relation in this one really disturbed me, and also the subtle erotic theme that hung around all the vampiric, physical action."
SarahBrown	validation	Stanley Kubrick	Park-wook has really, really mastered his cinematography in this film, and owes a lot to ███████████████; there are a whole lot of beautiful shots strewn throughout the film, some for simple effects and some that require several glances and probably repeated views to fully catch.
SarahBrown	validation	Chan-wook Park's	████████████████ new film is a complex film that is not easy to classify.
SarahBrown	validation	Emile Zola's	"The film takes its own matters and mixes them with classic European literature, in this case ████████████ ""Thérèse Raquin""."
SarahBrown	validation	Chan-wook Park's	Although I've never seen the film, I couldn't help but feel like this was ████████████████ version of Twilight.
SarahBrown	validation	Park	The psychological aspect that I love about ████'s previous films is in Thirst, as well.
SarahBrown	validation	Chan-wook Park	██████████████ bites into the vampire mythology with Thirst and puts his own dark, psychological twist on it.
SarahBrown	validation	Park Chan-wook	Anything ██████████████ creates is guaranteed to be unique, brilliant, and very twisted at a minimum.
SarahBrown	validation	Park Chan-wook	As negative as it may sound the positives definitely outweigh the negatives and another volume has without a doubt been added to the dark and twisted Zeitgeist of ██████████████ film.
SarahBrown	validation	Bakjwi	That was not the case when I watched ██████, under the American title Thirst.
SarahBrown	validation	Bakjwi	 There aren't many negatives I can say about ██████.
SarahBrown	validation	Dracula	"""bakjwi"" literally means bat in korean and we all know that in many classic vampire stories, you see count ███████ or vampires turning into a bat and fly away or wuheva."
SarahBrown	validation	aesop	Duality of human nature = if you ever read █████'s fables, there is this one fable where mammals and birds are fighting and a bat just can't seem to take a side and it tries to play both sides to his advantage.
SarahBrown	validation	Chan-wook Park	██████████████ is a master of cinematography and this movie is no exception.
SarahBrown	validation	Chan-wook Park	██████████████ is no stranger to controversy as we know, and this film touches on taboo almost as much as oldboy.
SarahBrown	validation	Hyeon	Instead of legitimately dying, █████ becomes a vampire, always yearning for the sustenance blood gives for him to fight off an infectious disease which returns causing the symptoms which flat-lined him to begin with(..bumps/sores, and the body vomits blood).
SarahBrown	validation	Hyeon	Sunlight, as is known in the vampire genre, causes torturous death if exposed to █████ for a length of time.
SarahBrown	validation	Hyeon	In doing so, █████ has created a monster.
SarahBrown	validation	Park Chan-Wook	██████████████ throws that concept completely out the window and shows directly what he wants--and what he wants to show is pretty much anything he can think of.
SarahBrown	validation	Park	Leaving it to the actors and dialog to create subtlety, from a stylistic perspective ████ seems willing to do just about anything to get his point across.
SarahBrown	validation	Chan-Wook	█████████ adds some much needed humour into the film, but this is only realised in the final third of the movie.
SarahBrown	validation	Park Chun-wook's	'Thirst' is original, entertaining and fortunately a little less weird than ████████████████ earlier endeavors.
SarahBrown	validation	Chan-wook Park	██████████████, you have to hand it to the guy.
SarahBrown	validation	Clancy Brown	"Co-star ████████████ (HBO's ""Carnivale"" - great to see him again) played the captain of the Coast Guard's Kodiak, Alaska base in a strong, convincing role as a leader with the prerequisite and necessary ice water in his veins."
SarahBrown	validation	Sang	There's nothing terribly weepy or insipid with the story and characters at any point, and the implications put forth from religion early on (████, for example, is seen as a healer of sorts since he rose from the dead thanks to his vampirism, even as he just can't be that and knows it) on top of those about good vs evil, push it up into another plane cinematically.
SarahBrown	validation	Chan-wook Park	Korean cinema has the ability to turn genres on its head, and the latest by the celebrated director ██████████████ is a tale of a good pious priest who becomes a vampire.
SarahBrown	testing	Kevin Costner	The mentor this time is played perfectly by █████████████; An ordinary man with common everyday problems who lives an extraordinary conviction, to save lives.
SarahBrown	testing	Costner	While his scenes with the local love interest are a tad stiff and don't generate enough heat to melt butter, he compliments ███████ well.
SarahBrown	testing	Leonard Maltin	Well, I have to disagree with ██████████████ on this animated short.
SarahBrown	testing	Bob McKimson	Director ████████████ offers endless laughters by means of absurd and unexpected demonstrative humour.
SarahBrown	testing	Maria Von Trapp	"It will be the death of ███████████████"" Fascinating study on changing an image."
SarahBrown	testing	Julie	█████ is beautiful and uses her many talents, throughout the film.
SarahBrown	testing	Julie Andrews	Fun, entertaining movie about WWII German spy (█████████████!)
SarahBrown	testing	Rosie Perez	Had to do a double take when I saw that was ███████████ there.
SarahBrown	testing	Merkerson	But, overall a great film with a truly outstanding performance by █████████.
SarahBrown	testing	Ruben Santiago Hudson	Of course, none of this would have been possible if █████████████████████ hadn't written his wonderful play.
wboncal	training	Patrick Deware	'Gerard and the late ██████████████ are two bitch-slapping, hippy drifters with many sexual insecurities, going around molesting women and committing petty crimes.

wboncal	training	Eddie Murphy	A strange role for ████████████ to take at the height of his career.
wboncal	training	Olivia DeHavilland	An excellent period murder melodrama, with Fontaine effectively playing against her earlier naive wallflower type, in a role that reportedly ██████████████████ turned down.
wboncal	training	Sofia Loren	She is ███████████, who is the wife of brutish public servant and mother of six children.
wboncal	training	John Holmes	Just saying you've got a movie about ███████████ is a guarantee to get some folks in front of the screen, but writer/director James Cox delivers oh so much more.

wboncal	training	Show People	Prior to seeing ███████████, my impression of silent comedy was essentially slapstick, and slapstick only.
wboncal	training	Tim Krabbé	The great plot comes from the novel by ██████████, who also adapted this story for the screen.

wboncal	training	Leslie Nielsen	Some will probably see this film simply to catch a glimpse of young, good-looking ██████████████ in one of his first starring roles.

wboncal	training	Sean Young	By all reports, ██████████ proves a weird person, and she is scarcely beautiful.
wboncal	training	Jamie Foxx	I had no expectations; I'd never heard of ██████████; all I knew was that the film has some strong character actors in it.
wboncal	training	Jane Russell	The sketch that brought the house down had them in a pub, wearing flat caps and mufflers, fantasising about movie stars such as ████████████ and Greta Garbo.

wboncal	training	Shannon Elizabeth	The beatiful █████████████████ (American Pie)did her first major movie role.
wboncal	training	Mike Binder	That, I think, is the main message ███████████'s newest film Reign Over Me brings across.

wboncal	validation	Ned Kelly	Ledger plays █████████ with dignity and intensity, showing us how an highly spirited boy became Australia's most notorious killer.

usma92	training	Matthew Rhys	████████████ performance of the stupid boy coming to big London and sudden taking drugs from people he does noteven know does not seem very credible,
usma92	training	Chris Cooper	The film boasts an incredible performance from ████████████ who shows an amazing versatility in the exploration of his role.
usma92	training	Patricia Clarkson	█████████████████ is equally as stellar and realistic in a role that many actresses would crumble in.

usma92	training	David Boreanaz	██████████████ gives a wonderful performance as the adult male who clearly gets himself into more trouble than he can handle.
usma92	training	John Hazlett	This information was actually confirmed by the director himself ████████████ at the Q&A after the film.
usma92	training	John Hazlett	I had the pleasure of meeting ████████████ tonight who seemed like a very nice guy and was very appreciative of the comments made about the film.
usma92	training	Keith Clark	But this summer is going to be a special one as they all blackmail ███████████ 
usma92	training	Caroline Dhavernas	(██████████████████) is the ringleader who basically doesn't know what to do with her life after High School
usma92	training	Thomas Jane	It had been a while since i seen it, but it does feature ███████████ in the first role i seen him in.
usma92	training	Paulina Porizkova	█████████████████ is dressed as a cheerleader type, looking very fresh and hot.
usma92	training	Tom Selleck	Sexy and lethal, like in the one movie with ███████████, but with a never seen before malevolence.
usma92	training	Aaron Eckhart	I stumbled onto it at the video store and rented it because █████████████
usma92	training	Mickey Rourke	For you █████████████ fans...
usma92	training	Bock	I said 'no ████ don't do it. You're a doctor, a healer, you're a necessary person, you're life is meaningful'.
usma92	training	George C. Scott	Black comedy features a 'tour-de-force' performance from veteran actor ███████████████
usma92	training	Scott	Hospital is as black of a comedy as "Network" is, and the excellent cast, led by the incomparable █████, does his work full justice.
usma92	training	Pepe Le Pew	This short, a formative cartoon featuring ███████████ , concerns a cat who thinks he'll solve all his problems by pretending to be a skunk.
usma92	training	Betty Boop	After all, ██████████ was in part responsible for the Production Code coming into existance.
usma92	training	Aihara	██████, an aloof girl, will definitely make the viewers ponder who IS behind the aloof girl.
usma92	training	Yoshida	Does she love ████████
usma92	training	Ito	Or does she love ████
usma92	training	Alastair Sim	This film is funny, having great sight gags and ████████████ is great.
usma92	validation	Bill Paxton	Actor turned director ███████████ follows up his promising debut, the Gothic-horror "Frailty", with this family friendly sports drama about the 1913 U.S. Open
usma92	validation	Harry Vardon	The movie depicted well the psychological battles that ████████████ fought within himself,
usma92	validation	Shia Lebouf	I didn't realize how charming ███████████ could be.
usma92	validation	Josh Flitter	And ████████████ as the ten year old caddy threatens to steal every scene in which he appears.
usma92	validation	Stephen Dillane	███████████████ is excellent as usual,
usma92	validation	Francis	But despite these handicaps, ███████ displays courage, spirit, heroism, and humility at this world class event.
usma92	validation	Hongsheng	Maybe I'm reading into this too much, but I wonder how much of a hand █████████ had in developing the film.
usma92	validation	Jia Hongsheng	I found the █████████████ story interesting.
usma92	validation	Lennon	Like ██████, he has gained success without a loss of identity.
usma92	validation	John Lennon	His devotion to The Beatles and ███████████ is a great metaphor for his life and the helplessness he feels.
usma92	validation	Custer	The film chronicles ██████ from the moment that he arrives at West Point Academy until the Indians massacre him at the Little Big Horn.
usma92	validation	Sheridan	Indeed, ████████ was a lieutenant at this point.
usma92	validation	Moreland	So much so that in one scene it looked like it might have been ████████ hamming it up in a dress.
usma92	validation	Mickael Curtiz	After working on 7 movies with director ██████████████ (The Adventures of Robin Hood are their best achievement),
usma92	validation	Bette Davis	This is worth stressing, as he was often derided as an actor by ███████████ et al.
usma92	validation	Spencer Tracy	much better than the much vaunted █████████████ or many other stars could have done.
usma92	validation	Anthony Quinn	the young █████████████ getting a start as Crazy Horse
usma92	validation	Madonna	Plus, the acting was great, and ███████ is my idol and she did a phat job!
usma92	validation	Griffin Dunne	█████████████ plays the hapless future groom/puppet who is sent to escort her from prison to the bus station, where a series of unfortunate events occurs, thus creating the plot.
usma92	validation	Mozart	So this movie is to "The Godfather" as new wave music is to ██████.
usma92	validation	Joe Estevez	███████████ may not have his brothers career, but does a good job of bringing focus to the story
usma92	validation	Ed Harris	And █████████ will win for BEST SUPPORTING ACTOR.
usma92	validation	Cuba Gooding	Then there is a black retarded frightened but pleasant fellow, ████████████,
usma92	validation	Stewart	The rest of the film is a puzzle as ███████ tries to save them and solve the mystery.
usma92	validation	Albert Hall	The final scene takes place in ███████████ and is one of the most famous in film which lasts for 12 minutes with no dialog.
usma92	validation	Alfred Hitchcock	████████████████ shall always remain over the top of any directors of his time.
usma92	validation	Truffaut	████████ argued that the earlier version of "The Man Who Knew Too Much" lacked the depth of the later version.
usma92	validation	Reggie Malder	The casting of character actor █████████████ as the assassin, is brilliant.
usma92	validation	Max Fleischer	This was another in the series of excellent cartoons █████████████ produced for Paramount Studio.
usma92	validation	Lois Lane	With intrepid reporter █████████ as the only passenger on board,
usma92	testing	Randolph Scott	As usual, ██████████████ put in another relaxed and realistic performance.
usma92	testing	Fritz Lang	However, for the life of me, I have no idea why ██████████ was assigned to direct this film--after all, he knew nothing about Westerns.
usma92	testing	Dean Jagger	While nice guy ███████████ (sporting lots of hair) did his best to get this done, there was a bad guy just waiting to undo this for his own selfish reasons.
usma92	testing	Clive Barker	████████████, the man who brought "Hellraiser", makes a horror movie that is part-Goth, part-Mythology, and all horror in-between.
usma92	testing	Danny Elfman	The ████████████ composed score is as good as it gets, and is among his best work.
usma92	testing	Doug Bradley	The rest of the cast, which includes ████████████ is very good, save for the ridiculously over the top redneck sheriff.
usma92	testing	David Cronenberg	I love this movie, even though, as many of the reviewers have noted, the expressions of the actors (with the exception of ████████████████, who does a wonderful appearance) are rather tacky.
usma92	testing	Vincent D'Onofrio	On the outside, this film is better because of █████████████████ (Law & Order: Criminal Intent), but this film is equally as good as the 1982 version.
usma92	testing	Shemp	One of My favorite Stooges shorts with █████ is none other than Brideless Groom!
usma92	testing	Curly	I prescribe 'Brideless Groom' as medicine for anyone who thinks the Stooges' glory years ended when █████ left.
xingqidi	training	Brokeback Mountain	I have recently seen this movie due to Jake's recent success with ██████████████████.
xingqidi	training	Darth Vader	His journey carries the movie as he moves closer to his confrontation with ███████████ and his fate.
xingqidi	training	Al Pacino	And of course you have █████████ in a rather small supporting role but he's absolutely brilliant at it and outshines and overshadows every other actor in the film.
xingqidi	training	David Strathairn	Needing a role in that mold, we are given a nice turn from ████████████████.
xingqidi	training	John Forsythe	Leading the investigation is █████████████, but the other three detectives are great as well.
xingqidi	training	Citizen Kane	This adjective describes the performers; the characters; the chemistry between and among all of the characters, in whatever combination presented, and all of the supporting and even minor roles.I love films with a "harder edge:" "Rounders;" the escapist Schwarzenegger/Stallone fare; "Goodfellows;" even the classics like "Casablanca," "Gone With the Wind," "████████████."
xingqidi	training	Stanley Holloway	To the new Burgundians, however, this is an unexpected opportunity to live as they please, free from any interference from Whitehall.████████████████ is excellent as the minor city politician who suddenly finds himself leading one of the world's tiniest nations.
xingqidi	training	Abraham Lincoln	We all know of ███████████████ as the 16th president that did the emancipation and after the Civil war got assassinated.
xingqidi	training	Alpha Video	I love buying those cheap, lousy DVD's from ███████████.
xingqidi	training	Robert Montgomery	It was a careful choice - Sanders usually would play villains with occasional "nice roles" (ffoliott in FOREIGN CORRESPONDENCE, the title hero in THE STRANGE CASE OF UNCLE HARRY, the framed "best friend" of █████████████████ in RAGE IN HEAVEN).
xingqidi	training	Frank Sinatra	Seeing █████████████ when he was very young and extremely thin with sunken in cheeks and a wonderful voice which sang some great old songs.
xingqidi	training	Walt Disney	It's the same guy who maid the music for ███████████'s version of Zorro, who maid the Fightin Legion music.
xingqidi	training	Brighton Rock	I think I saw "█████████████" once many years ago and liked it but maybe I'm simply thinking fondly of the novel.)
xingqidi	training	Donkey Kong	Everything from the speaking to the SFX are pleasant and realistic.The camera angle is a bit frustrating at times, but it's the same for every platform game, like Banjo-Kazooie and ███████████ 64.I got this game as a Christmas present in 1997, and since then, I have dutifully gotten 120 stars over 10 times.
xingqidi	training	Ralph Richardson	There is far more human life in this part though, with the great ████████████████ sailing gloriously over-the-top as the small dictator, the "Boss" of the Everytown.
xingqidi	training	Greg Kinnear	Add the kind-hearted, uber-likable American "guy next door', ████████████, to set up contrast.
xingqidi	training	David Baddiel	I believe the minimal sound design and cheap camera is a conscious decision rather than bad film making, I'd defend this, the film isn't any worse as a result, and it puts the spotlight on the cast, some of whom are really good (Kate Hardie- think that's her name, as the sarcastic drunk is spot-on) the one exception being █████████████, who should never be allowed to appear in serious stuff!!
xingqidi	training	Ella Raines	Sadly ███████████ was never given such a great part again, and eventually ended up in poorly produced westerns.
xingqidi	training	Paul Lukas	Everyone is entitled to compare films they choose, but the similarities of "The Mortal Storm" and "Watch On The Rhine" are clearly the problems of refugees threatened by the Nazi juggernaut, while the main comparative point brought out with "Casablanca" is the seeming unjust treatment of Humphrey Bogart in 1943 by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Science, because they chose ██████████ instead for the Best Actor Oscar.
xingqidi	training	Ciaran Hinds	(IMO the newer A&E production suffers in that ████████████ - whom I normally adore - seems to bluster and bully his way throughout.
xingqidi	training	Marin Preda	This tells something certainly about the value, or maybe about the lack of universality of the film, but also tells something about how different history and even life of common people was in Romania compared to other countries, even in Eastern Europe.The film is an adaptation of a novel by ███████████, a controversial novelist who died during the Communist rule soon after the book was published.
xingqidi	training	Marc Dixon	"Where the Sidewalk Ends," a fairly difficult to find film -- the only copy in perhaps the best stocked video store in Manhattan was a rough bootleg from the AMC cable channel -- belongs in a category with these classics.From the moment the black cloud of opening credits pass, a curtain is drawing around rogue loner detective ██████████'s crumbling world, and as the moments pass, it inches ever closer, threatening suffocation.
xingqidi	training	Simon Peacock	It's a very gory start, and bodes well for the rest of the film.Unfortunately, after this promising beginning, things start to go seriously downhill: we are introduced to the main characters, an annoying bunch of twenty-somethings just begging to become cannibal chow, and are subjected to a fair amount of time wasting in the form of some terrible false scares, a lot of blarney about murderous druids from local Irish weirdo Gary (█████████████), and worst of all, some sub-Scream, post-modernistic conversation about the conventions of horror films (how clever!
xingqidi	training	Academy Award	It may not be █████████████ material but it is absolutely guaranteed to turn a bad day into a darn good one.
xingqidi	training	James C. Petrillo	Both of them were denounced by the president of the union, █████████████████ as strikebreakers and both did not cross the picket line again.
xingqidi	training	Nicholas Cage	It's the best role that I have ever seen for █████████████, but almost everybody seems perfectly cast.
xingqidi	training	Will Smith	I have the Highest Respects for ██████████ as he is not only a brilliant Actor but one can tell he has a genuine love for people and life which no doubt made him perfect for the character (IRS Agent Ben Thomas) he played in this film.
xingqidi	training	Paul Reiser	Obviously this is a labor of love for ███████████ who understands what it's like to be both a father and a son, as well as to have both laughter and tears as you move through life.
xingqidi	training	Alistair Cooke	It expands their critical thinking.Impartially, with the participants on all sides explaining in their own words what they did and why, it details what lead up to the war and the actual war.Buy it for your children, along with ██████████████'s America.
xingqidi	training	Heero Yuy	Purists can stick to Japanese all they want, but for a more "realistic" experience i recommend the English track since all the characters, except █████████, are not Japanese.
xingqidi	training	Mr. Wells	He did not direct after this Sci-Fi epic opera he and █████████ created, but his film imagery, sets, and design are very recognizable.That imagery is very effecting.
xingqidi	training	Mélanie Thierry	And the only one time where he was weakened is when ███████████████ shaved his beard !
xingqidi	training	Al Pacino	A lot of people are saying that █████████ over acted but I mean common obviously for a movie role like this -- a cuban drug lord you need a bit of over acting in this role with that cuban accent.
xingqidi	training	Michael Parks	Also █████████████ as modern sheriff is a bit underused in his role.
xingqidi	training	Harlan Ellison	It reminds me of ██████████████'s spooky short story, FLOP SWEAT.
xingqidi	training	Gary Busey	Unfortunately, ██████████'s role was too small and limited.
xingqidi	training	Robin Hood	This must have been very hep for 1936, but rather way way out and had nothing to do with the film, ██████████ did not make an appearance as far as I could see.
xingqidi	training	Art Director Dave Milton	This was also the first time that ████████████████████████ got a chance to spread his wings.
xingqidi	training	Michael Jackson	It's a kind of strange combination of a bio of ███████████████, a collection of musical vignettes, and a story about a super hero fighting to save some little kids.
xingqidi	training	Family Guy	Father of the Pride was the best new show to hit television since ██████████.
xingqidi	training	Harrison Ford	This is the man that made █████████████ run hard and run fast.
xingqidi	training	John Fulton	The special effects, by the always innovative ███████████, are terrific and the supporting actors are all adequate.
xingqidi	training	Imaginary Heroes	!i first got into ryan from watching the OC and then saw him in a bunch of good indies like ████████████████.
xingqidi	training	Dark Heart	Than the club & cousin bears have grown up to get ready to fight ██████████.
xingqidi	training	Sir Alan Sugar	!For fans of this i highly recommend the UK version starring ██████████████ as the boss.
xingqidi	training	Herbert Hoover	Madison is a carefree happy-go-lucky if rather irresponsible slob who's refrigerator was last cleaned probably when ██████████████ was still in the White House.
xingqidi	training	Picture Oscar	It also won the Best █████████████, being the first - and only - X-rated motion picture to do so.
xingqidi	training	Al Pacino	In a role he was born to play, █████████ stars as New York's mayor who has to deal with the shooting of a boy.
xingqidi	training	Nancy Drew	It also has encouraged my daughter to start reading the original ██████████ mysteries which I am sure she will love much as I loved the Hardy Boys.
xingqidi	training	Jane Eyre	I watched this film and then █████████ right after... she just keeps getting better.
xingqidi	validation	George Stevens	However the continual forays into comedy  such as the spiked punch routine  make this "slow" portion bearable.Producer-director ██████████████ was a natural when it came to this sort of thing, himself having cut his teeth at the Hal Roach studios, and almost exclusively having directed comedy up to this point.
xingqidi	validation	Gentleman Jim	Typical forties flick teeming w/ familiar faces and fast paced scenes, one after the other.Flynn is fine as █████████████, you never get past a 1 dimensional look at him or the rest here, I suppose, but it's okay, it's a cartoon and meant to please, that's all.
xingqidi	validation	Grace Elliot	Rohmer returns to his historical dramas in the real story of ████████████, an Englishwoman who stayed in France during the apex of the French Revolution.
xingqidi	validation	Chloe Franks	The most outstanding contribution, however, is that of the 7-year-old ████████████ who turns in chillingly effective account of her part which makes one's blood run cold.
xingqidi	validation	Miranda Richardson	It says something when ██████████████████ does her usual fine work and yet is overshadowed by so many others in the cast.
xingqidi	validation	Deep Space	The cast and crew have truly come up with something special here, and, as a whole,I would highly recommend this series to fans of The Next Generation and ██████████ 9.
xingqidi	validation	Seijun Suzuki	It just feels very fresh and original, with some imaginative use of sets and lighting, and some hints to █████████████ and Jean-Pierre Melville.
xingqidi	validation	Weird Al	I was always a big ████████ fan and when I saw this video I rented and watched it.
xingqidi	validation	Guy Kibbee	Besides those already mentioned, ██████████ is at his flustered best here.7 out of 10
xingqidi	validation	Please Obey	!Here's a message to all those brave sainik(soldier)-sons please respect the father of the nation!███████████ and happiness shall be bestowed or else it's a disaster in waiting,isn't it?
xingqidi	validation	Brock Lesnar	WWE Intercontenital championship: RVD v. ████████████ 8/10 This was a very intense and good match.
xingqidi	validation	Patrick Warburton	As a man married for 26 years, I empathize with █████████████████'s character: he loves his wife, but he assumes she knows that.
xingqidi	validation	Robert Louis Stevenson	Based on ██████████████████████'s St. Ives, the film tells the story of a dashing young French Hussar captain (Jean Marc Barr) during the Napoleonic wars.
xingqidi	validation	Franka Pontente	An excellent example of a simple idea developed into a compelling 90 minute script.The set up requires no bells and whistles, no lengthy exposition or wordy back story; Kate (███████████████), a young German business woman living in London, drifts off whilst waiting for the last tube train.
xingqidi	validation	Randy Edelman	Not only do the exteriors look authentically bleak (shot exclusively in the most run-down parts of otherwise spectacular Budapest), but █████████████'s soaring soundtrack is entirely overwhelming--and frequently our only respite from the bleak brutality.
xingqidi	validation	Dirty Harry	Despite the other comments listed here, this is probably the best ███████████ movie made; a film that reflects -- for better or worse -- the country's socio-political feelings during the Reagan glory years of the early '80's.
xingqidi	validation	Basic Instinct	She was just as good as she was in the first ██████████████.
xingqidi	validation	Steve Martin	Davis (████████████ with a great beard) asks himself 'Is my making a violent movie (and by extension our enjoyment of it) causing the violence in society?'
xingqidi	validation	Conrad L. Hall	And along the way, savor the visual brilliance of cinematographer ██████████████ (9 nominations, 2 oscars for best cinematography): rain pouring off fedoras, shots through mirrors (especially on swinging doors), tommy-gun flashes from out of the shadows, absent any sound.
xingqidi	validation	Bill Sikes	Lacking in judgment, she ignores ██████████' violent nature out of her deep need for love.
xingqidi	validation	Miss Europe	The tango also plays a plot point in "Prix," being the music she danced with on her short rise to stardom after becoming ███████████.
xingqidi	validation	Grace Hartman	█████████████, who died of cancer at age 48, did almost no film work, so it's a real pleasure that this film gives us a rare chance to see her close-up, to hear her beautiful singing voice and to notice how sexy she looks in her maid's uniform.
xingqidi	validation	Joseph Goebbels	Unarmed, unorganized, and leaderless, they faced down the most brutal forces at the disposal of the Third Reich.███████████████, the Gauleiter (governor or district leader) of Berlin, anxious to have that city racially cleansed, was also in charge of the nation's public morale.
xingqidi	validation	Bill Paxton	After all it's not everyday that someone comes in to your office to tell you that he knows who the killer is.The film has many twists, and ███████████ directs splendidly by keeping us guessing without losing interest.
xingqidi	validation	John Speredakos	This angers some of the locals--especially Otis (███████████████) and things slowly (VERY slowly) go wrong.I was expecting the worst when I started watching this.
xingqidi	validation	Ralph Faulkner	I also like the way he dispenses with Sebastian in the first episode.I watched this again because I had good memories of it from years back, there are some good stunts and good music, it has the ingredients you expect including water,rockfalls,runaway carts... Apart from the first episode(with ██████████████)the swordplay wasn't nearly as good as I remembered it, and yes it features the inevitable "flashback" episode!
xingqidi	validation	Julie Delpy	The primary reason to see "Before Sunrise," is to watch a young ███████████ deliver her lines.
xingqidi	validation	John Ford	My guess is that █████████ wanted him as a sympathetic character to give movie fans some rooting interest.
xingqidi	validation	Desert Island	Like the "█████████████" game, the film looks at how even best friends, when left alone together, can fall apart, but at the same time it shows that friends are vital to the quality of existence.
xingqidi	validation	Archibald Cunningham	Tim Roth masterfully portrays his major adversary and surely one of the most heinous and sadistic cinematic villains, ████████████████████, an egotistical, ruthless strutting peacock.
xingqidi	testing	Riff Randell	It tells the story of ████████████, adorably played by P.J.
xingqidi	testing	Robert Downey Jr	But like I said before, it's hard not to love any movie with ████████████████.
xingqidi	testing	De Sica	Neo-realism, by the way, could rightfully be claimed as this being a forefather (along with ███████'s The Children Are Watching Us), which that would take shape after the war.
xingqidi	testing	Harry Cohn	Tone/Neal/Welles are only a few -and this includes a butchered film called "The Lady From Shanghai"..."Lady From Shanghai" took two years to be released, thanks to extensive re-editing -and all because Columbia president ██████████ couldn't understand the story.
xingqidi	testing	Pierce Brosnon	Not to mention easily ██████████████'s best performance.
xingqidi	testing	Jeffrey Goines	At the same time, Cole continues talking about a dream he keeps having in which she also plays a part as a blonde woman running down the aisle, screaming for help, after shots have rung out and a particular red-headed man in a ponytail (██████████████?)
xingqidi	testing	James Bond	But overall, this game is the best ██████████ experience so far.
xingqidi	testing	Jeremy Northam	With a beautiful setting, wonderful costumes, and an outstanding cast (have I mentioned the gorgeous ██████████████?
xingqidi	testing	Dil Wale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge	Easily the best film produced in Bollywood this century.The only other Indian film I would give 10/10 for is █████████████████████████████.
xingqidi	testing	Red Queen	In fact, all the visuals are interesting with the laughing █████████ running across the bridge at night being one of my favorite moments in the film.
zwben	training	Dreyfuss	████████ was perfect as the actor/impostor, full of all the little neuroses and vanities you imagine actors to have.
zwben	training	Raul	████ Julia was superb as the Paradorian Chief of Secret Police.
zwben	training	Julia	Raul █████ was superb as the Paradorian Chief of Secret Police.
zwben	training	Sonia Braga	And ███████████ was excellent as the girl friend -- in addition to being a really hot number: "You should get an Oscar for tonight!"
zwben	training	Johnny Winters	Let us not forget ██████████████ as the CIA agent and the several guest stars playing themselves: Sammy Davis Jr., Ike Pappas, Dick Cavett -- all perfectly done.. All in all, a memorable romp under the Paradorian moon.. -R.

zwben	training	Raul Julia	While "The Kiss of the Spider Woman" cast ██████████ as a political prisoner in an unidentified Latin American country, this time he works for a dictator in a fictional Latin American country.
zwben	training	Richard Dreyfuss	Specifically, the dictator suddenly drops dead, so Julia replaces el presidente with a Broadway actor (████████████████) shooting a movie in the country.
zwben	training	Dreyfuss	From there, ████████ has to figure out how to be a dictator, all the while balancing it with his own life.. Is it appropriate to turn the tense situation in Latin America into comedy?
zwben	training	Richard Dreyfuss	It just goes to show why ████████████████ is one of the greatest actors of our era, and what we lost when Raul Julia died.

Flippen, Tony Curtis, Rock Hudson among them  and Mann's outstanding visual sense raise the bar with this one.

zwben	validation	Clint Eastwood	Being essentially a revenge film, it shares this element with many other examples of the genre, such as Jack Arnold's No Name on the Bullet, and ██████████████'s Unforgiven.
zwben	validation	Stewart	All five films had the revenge and the dark past on ███████'s part play into the film, to the point where this is not just ███████'s dark side, but also actually a sort of character, not one to be listed in the credits, but one that you can only recognize and know that it is there, always present.
zwben	validation	Stewart	However, this one, not just on revenge and the dark past, but also in terms of supreme danger, and characters that were very different than ███████ make it surpass the other four in all aspects.

zwben	testing	Rock Hudson	Look for the first appearance of ███████████ as Young Bull.
zwben	testing	Eric Stoltz	Surprisingly, it was the adults that captured the audiences attention.. ███████████ gives a stellar performance as Daniel Greystone, a man so haunted by his family tragedy that he jumps at the first chance of getting out of his grief and doesn't let go.

rheahanks	testing	Bush	The aim of the director is obvious--to use an interweaving of speeches/poems as a way to argue against the ████ doctrine.
rheahanks	testing	Darwin	All ██████'s missing links are still MISSING !
rheahanks	testing	Dr. Dre	His comedy raps proved to be a huge influence on latter day gangsta rap, including ███████ who sampled him on his groundbreaking 1992 album "The Chronic"."
rheahanks	testing	Hirsch	██████ was obviously working with a low budget here & it shows
rheahanks	testing	Queen Bee	Actors that you would never want to see naked get naked (including the Mayor and █████████).
rheahanks	testing	Rik Mayall	I had seen ██████████ in Blackadder and the New Statesman, so I thought I'd give this film a try."
rheahanks	testing	Rik Mayall	And ██████████, you can do better, so please, do!"
rheahanks	testing	Rudy Ray Moore	Since ██████████████ was originally a comedian, I begin to wonder if this film was meant to be a spoof or a serious action film.
rheahanks	testing	Spalding Gray	Three of the things you can say about █████████████ are: he certainly marched to the beat of his own "drummer;" he was never at a loss for words; and he obviously felt that those watching and listening to him would be interested in every aspect of his life, experiences and thoughts - no matter how trivial at times.
rheahanks	testing	Willie Green	With this army of kung fu fighting "hoes" (his words, not mine) on his side, he plans to take back the nightclub from ████████████.
rheahanks	training  Barry Levinson  ██████████████ is a slightly overrated director and really did not do a good job here.
rheahanks	training	Ben Stiller	The acting was what you would expect especially out of ███████████.
rheahanks	training	Bettina Hirsch	Directed by ██████████████ this has to be one of the worst horror comedy's ever
rheahanks	training	Bill	The acting for the most part is very wooden (the only exception is Adrien Brody’s performance as Solo's creator ████) and the story is slight enough that you would probably forget it WHILST you where watching the film.
rheahanks	training	Byron Calhoun	He just doesn't look or act like a small-town Southern lawman named █████████████.
rheahanks	training	Carmen Miranda	In some parts I felt that ██████████████ may appear within parrots and palm trees.

rheahanks	training	Crispin Glover	██████████████, while always entertaining to watch, seems a bit out of place as the manic stoner and leader of the group.
rheahanks	training	Daniel Roebuck	The best performance however is definitely ██████████████.
rheahanks	training	De Niro	In the past I've thought ███████ to be a cold and unexpressive actor given horribly to mugging when called upon to do comedy.
rheahanks	training	Dennis Hopper	█████████████ (on the comeback trail with this, "Blue Velvet", and "Hoosiers") gives a great performance as the creepy yet pathetic hippie generation leftover.

rheahanks	training	Irvin Kershner	Overlong by 20 minutes and filled with embarrassing moments for everyone involved, this film and "Robocop 2" are proof that ██████████████ did not have any real control over "The Empire Strikes Back."
rheahanks	training	Jack Black	██████████ I have always liked so you know what you will get out of him but this is not bad.
rheahanks	training	Jayne Mansfield	I think that at least much of the blame for this lies in casting ███████████████.

rheahanks	training	Jimmy McHugh	The songs (by ████████████ and Johnny Mercer) are nothing to brag out.
rheahanks	training	John Hughes	Don't mistake this for another lame ███████████ clichéd high school flick such as "The Breakfast Club".
rheahanks	training	Johnny Mercer	The songs (by Jimmy McHugh and █████████████) are nothing to brag out
rheahanks	training	Jonathan Scarfe	the brothers were totally convincing, and ███████████████ was perfect in the challenging role of Luke.
rheahanks	training	Kate	I did get to like the character of ████ by the end of the film as she seemed to soften and become a little more realistic by the end.

rheahanks	training	Lawrence Olivier	It's sort of like pairing Sir ████████████████ with Marjorie Main.
rheahanks	training	Luke	the brothers were totally convincing, and Jonathan Scarfe was perfect in the challenging role of ████.

rheahanks	training	Marjorie Main	It's sort of like pairing Sir Lawrence Olivier with █████████████.
rheahanks	training	Mitch	She thinks that █████ will give her the `edgy' boost it needs to be a hit but feels he may be too unlikable to carry the whole show by himself.
rheahanks	training	Mitch	In her zeal she re-vamps █████'s life to make it more camera friendly.
rheahanks	training	Nadine Van der Velde	Simon ask's Paul & his wife Cindy (████████████████████) to take care of it.
rheahanks	training	Nielson	She stalks through the movie chasing high ███████ ratings with awe-inspiring determination.

rheahanks	validation	Amy	On their side, the humans have a "talking" gorilla named ███ who helps save the day at one point or another.

rheahanks	validation	Ed Norton	This is right around the same time she appeared with Richard Gere and █████████ in PRIMAL FEAR, a movie that helped guarantee her stardom.
rheahanks	validation	Eddie	Can't forget when █████ is on his motorbike, and he needs to urinate....
rheahanks	validation	Herman	██████ has made northern drama his own with Little Voice and Brassed Off, but the formula falters in this ropey, flat and contrived tale of two teenage delinquents trying to get season tickets to see Newcastle.
rheahanks	validation	Herman	I am all for entertainment, and ██████'s track record shows he is aware of the need to balance the social message with laughs and tears.
rheahanks	validation	Jackie	I've only seen one ██████ film worse that this one and that was one of his early forays into Hollywood films that didn't turn out so well.
rheahanks	validation	Jackie Chan	I normally love ███████████ movies but this one was terrible.
rheahanks	validation	James Cagney	This is what ████████████ is all about, wisecracks, cockiness, hard as nails and no-nonsense charisma.
rheahanks	validation	Joe	Despite all its technical short-comings, this is an interesting film depicting a day in the life of ███, a hustler, determined to earn $200 for his wife's pregnant girl friend.
rheahanks	validation	Joe	One thing is certain, ███ is uninhibited when it comes to disrobing for sex or posing for an artist.
rheahanks	validation	Joe	███ stark naked is crouching on the floor feeding crumbs of cake to his little baby.
rheahanks	validation	Joe	Another scene of amusing interest is the one in which ███ desperately seeks a loan of $100 from a gym friend, coming to the point of asking in a very circuitous approach.
rheahanks	validation	Joe	It's a preliminary to another occasion when ███ divests himself of his clothes and poses as the discus thrower in true classical style.
rheahanks	validation	Joe	At the end of the film we gain the impression that we have got to know ███ pretty well.
rheahanks	validation	Joe Dallesandro	███████████████ is outstanding as the easy-going, passive, laid-back young man who is willing to let the other person do most of the talking while he listens with a faraway look in his eyes.
rheahanks	validation	Laura Linney	████████████ of all people is along for this bumpiest of rides.
rheahanks	validation	Neil Labute	only real complaint is that director ███████████ (who made a splash a few years ago with the very impressive and dark In the Company of Men') relied much too heavily on many cliched Hollywood conventions.
rheahanks	validation	Nick Hammond	I didn't think ████████████ was Peter Parker... and he was visibly of a different build than the guy who did the stunts in the spider suit.

rheahanks	validation	Seth McFarlane	Reason 2, The jokes are just generally hilarious, ██████████████ and the other writers are soooooooooooo funny, everything from the Star Wars references to making fun of celebrities, i love them all.
rheahanks	validation	Stephen Dorff	█████████████ does the best job of the whole cast here, as the "head" vampire you just love to hate.
rheahanks	validation	Tobey Macguire	Granted, I can also spot in the modern Spider-Man movies when I am looking at ██████████████ and when I am looking at CGI.
rheahanks	validation	Willie Green	However, the sympathetic warden (the only white character in the whole movie that isn't completely evil or incompetent) decides to spring him free to stop the evil ████████████ and his drug trafficking.
biswas-n	training	Pleasance	Rose is good, but it's █████████ who really stands out in this film.
biswas-n	training	Capt Dan	████████ is in love with a woman.
biswas-n	training	Raul Julio	I'll always remember the name ██████████ for this picture.
biswas-n	training	Tom Selleck	You have to like baseball, and you have to at least sort of like ███████████, but if you meet those criteria you should thoroughly enjoy this movie.
biswas-n	training	Charlie Sheen	The Middle East can no longer be written off as a sthole full of rag heads knocking each other off to quote █████████████ here it is now a place in which involvement can lead to severe consequences.
biswas-n	training	James Caan	The film, however, with a strong debut for ██████████, remains effective and affecting.
biswas-n	training	Atwill	██████ is as close to cardboard in this role as he could get.
biswas-n	training	Cat Soup	████████ is one of those films that, from Western eyes, is supposed to be experienced on drugs or deeply analyzed.
biswas-n	training	Chin	The parallel Roman world dominance West and East worlds was achieved without a single towering personality like ████.
biswas-n	training	Wesley Snipes	Don't waist your time this movie snt entertaining, if you wanna cry it might suffice though, even though your tears will be wept due to seeing █████████████ in the tragic action film wannabe comedy...
biswas-n	training	Mark Mothersbough	The song when they go to the Ping Islands is a really good electronic song by █████████████████, and the second I heard it I knew I had to download it.
biswas-n	training	Vidor	I normally dislike █████, who tended to be cast in glamour roles but wasn't pretty enough to justify them.
biswas-n	training	John Cleese	Let's not forget ███████████
biswas-n	training	Jess	████ loves to play pick up soccer games, the kind forbidden by her traditionalist mother.
biswas-n	training	Daryl Hannah	Sometimes ████████████ can seem a little spacy in her film roles, but its exactly that quality that makes her so perfect in the part of Madison.
biswas-n	training	Bronson	Chief tries to scare him off, but only makes his point after ███████ has been shot and has no other choice.
biswas-n	training	Tom ValcoJames Gandolfiniis	███████████████████████████ reluctant, but is greedy enough to take Drew's offer.
biswas-n	training	Joanna Pacula	█████████████ is OK.
biswas-n	training	Oscar	I liked the part where when those two British neighbors that speak to both gentlemen, and after █████ kicked out Felix, he gets lucky and lives with them when he refused to have dinner with them the night earlier.
biswas-n	training	Fifi	Let's get to the guys who went after Goucem's neighbor ████, what is their real motivation
biswas-n	training	J. Carrol Naish	Imagine ███████████████ as an insane doctor with dentures so fake the rattle with every word that comes out of his mouth.
biswas-n	training	Ben	███ is very nervous with his new patient, who forces compliments and demands upon him.
biswas-n	training	Lawn Bowlsbr	Go see it and learn the joys of ████████████
biswas-n	training	Ian	███ believes they're trapped in a culdesac and leaves them there.
biswas-n	training	Debbie	A rather sad bit was when ██████ tried and failed to match her shouty style which spoiled it a bit.
biswas-n	training	Brendon	███████ starts out straight but gets to learn that gay may be more than just an option for him and being bisexual might not be that bad after all.
biswas-n	training	Tim Boggs	This movie would apparently be the only movie █████████ ever directed, but he did go on to work in the industry for some notable movies.The baddie of this movie is some undeveloped old man character.
biswas-n	training	Inder Kumar	After Dil, Beta, Mann and Masti, ███████████'s this flick proves that he is a king of comedy.
biswas-n	training	Hari Om	Was very fortunate to see the movie ███████ at The Bermuda International Film Festival.
biswas-n	training	Gina Gershon	Here's a little nugget made for cable that revolves around a psychiatrist played by ████████████.
biswas-n	training	Brendan Filone	██████████████ is the best.
biswas-n	training	Olsen	Getting There I found too predictable, contrived and slow, and to this day I still consider it as the █████ twins' worst.
biswas-n	training	Waldemar	Unluckily for ████████ the cave belongs to two evil Vampire, cannibal, ancient god worshipping, nymphomaniac twin sisters.
biswas-n	training	Stevens	███████, perhaps the ablest filmmaker of the era next to Hitchcock, saw the profundity and catharsis in it, and the receptive, insightful control and room to allow his particularly personal vision to make it feel like the experience cinema is meant to be, a chronicle ensuing the lifechanging happening of falling in love, and the innate personal longing to make a family and a home with the one you worship, and the trials and grief that can be as intense, though never really more, than the pleasure and gratification it begets.
biswas-n	training	Jeff	Later, ████ - This looks decidedly like "the amateur" hour.
biswas-n	training	Antwone Fisher	██████████████ stands proudly alone in this regard race is irrelevant, save for one fight that may, or may not, have been provoked by a racial slur.
biswas-n	training	Max	In conclusion, don't watch it, but if you have nothing better to do with your life and you don't feel like renting Mad ███, you might watch this, if it will ever pass on tv.
biswas-n	training	Sandra Bullock	The acting is lousy sorry, ██████████████, but even your performance was horrible, the music score could have come from a bad xrated movie and the story was downright ridiculous.
biswas-n	training	Peter O'Toole	█████████████ has either had a really bad plastic surgery, or he is desperately in need of one.
biswas-n	training	Ridley Scott's	The Thing, the movie itself, is similar to ██████████████ iconic "Alien" 1979.
biswas-n	training	Lindy	█████ is unsinkable, a positive character that makes lemonade out of lemons.
biswas-n	training	Buck Henry	The only honest performance was turned in by ██████████, who plays a raving mental patient of course, since he also wrote the screenplay for this abomination, it was probably only typecasting.
biswas-n	training	Bogdanovich	In the meantime, the budding couple's respective children nepotism alert ███████████'s daughters spew cute and pick up some fairly disturbing pointers on 'love' while observing their parents.
biswas-n	training	Camelia Kath	And as for ████████████, I've seen better looking scarecrows in farmer's fields.
biswas-n	training	Hitler	But this miniseries is powerful and convincing because the talented cast really captures the dark truth of ██████'s world.
biswas-n	training	Alain Delon	For those seeking entertainment, watch the ███████████ thrillers featured in the DVD extras.
biswas-n	training	Sticky Fingers	There were a lot of rumors that said ██████████████ couldn't act.
biswas-n	training	Alice	The only one I felt for to some degree was █████, you could literally feel the stress she's under for having to negotiate between the writer and the network guys, always pretending it's not all that bad and everything is hunkydory.
biswas-n	training	Schwarzenegger	Unlike End of Days' or The Sixth Day', classic ██████████████ action films like Predator' never insult the audience by attempting to explain the often threadbare plot.
biswas-n	training	Kareena	Well if you really listen closely, whatever they speak is actually unintelligible.Camera work is bad, editing is not present, background score gives a headache, action is shoddy, dialogs are unintelligible, Acting is abysmal and well ███████ used to look like a wrestler, now she looks like a starved wrestler.
biswas-n	validation	John Carpenter's	Hm...but not if the sponsors saw "████████████████ Vampires".
biswas-n	validation	Temujin	The main reason for this is that the story of ███████ is rooted in a culture quite alien to the filmmakers and which they make little attempt to understand.
biswas-n	validation	Nolan	A fisherman █████ is out to nab a killer whale, a very bad thing, but when he accidentally ACCIDENTALLY mark you hits a pregnant cow instead of her mate, the cow and I use the word in all senses who is obviously a sick psychobitch and the canonical villain of the piece throws herself against the propellers trying to chew herself to bits in the most distressing and hideous not to mention ineffectual method of killing herself.
biswas-n	validation	Muriel	She doesn't get many of the funnier lines, but she combines her special blend of flightiness and sauciness to make ██████ an appealing character on her own.
biswas-n	validation	Libby	My favourite episodes are the one where she turns █████ into a geek, the first episode, the true love episode and most of the rest from the first series.
biswas-n	validation	John Savage	Poor ███████████ had to stoop this low in order to be in another movie.
biswas-n	validation	Anita Strindberg	Sexy ████████████████ is absolutely ravishing in the female lead.
biswas-n	validation	Dani Levy	Director and coscriptwriter █████████ does not bother about those mechanics, he thinks that certain things simply ARE funny, the fact that two orderlies are gay and kiss over a man in a coma, for example.
biswas-n	validation	Mick McCleery	The only real problem was the lead, █████████████.
biswas-n	validation	Murphy	He turns to ██████ as an ally of convenience.
biswas-n	validation	Burakov	I was almost in tears when he told ███████ how the FBI had so closely followed and admired his work.
biswas-n	validation	Jane	Plain ████, but maybe the director was dating her or something.
biswas-n	validation	Laurence Harvey	It also helps the movie that it features ███████████████ as the movie it's prime suspect.
biswas-n	validation	Ahmed	A noble, nicelooking sorry, I had to add that in, young thief named █████ who sneaks into the palace with the help of a magic rope and tries to steal, but changes his ways when he falls for the Caliph's daughter.
biswas-n	validation	Steven Seagal	I like █████████████
biswas-n	validation	Dolittle	Dr. ████████ has ended and number 2 starts.
biswas-n	validation	George Orwell	But for English this year, year 11, we had to read Animal Farm, also by █████████████.
biswas-n	validation	Ninza Turtles	I saw very many, much was pleasant to me were a favorite "█████████████", and from "ThunderCats" I then saw only one episode about huge spiders, but they have sunk down to me in soul and later 20 years they ThunderCats is my favorite cartoon serial from serious and from comic "The Pink Panther" and I now try to extract a full serial on disks in the original without a translation into Russian.
biswas-n	validation	Stephen King 	mostly for the first 25 minsI love █████████████I read most of his books not this oneand there are some good and of course some bad
biswas-n	validation	Mike Nicholas's Closer	Law is once again reprising his similar role in ██████████████████████, which was unfortunately a disappointment to the fan of Law who wish to see something new and different from him.
biswas-n	validation	Jennifer Lopez	I don't really enjoy ██████████████.
biswas-n	validation	Meh	███, I am not going to be angry at this movie, i knew what i was getting into and if you're looking for a bad movie to watch with friends, here's what I recommend Watch this movie, then immediately watch Jurassic Park and then Lost World back to back.
biswas-n	validation	max	And even worse, the incessant, walltowall music, dull and hypnotic to the ███, opens up a giant chasm between the film and the viewer.
biswas-n	validation	Matt	Especially with her remarks about 'going to the funeral of her best friend', when she first meets ████.
biswas-n	validation	Michelle Pieffer	████████████████ is very ironic and cynical.
biswas-n	validation	Ryan	████ already in Columbia, will join the party.
biswas-n	validation	Ray Bolger	And like clowns, scarecrows can be very creepy unless they look like ██████████, of course.
biswas-n	validation	James Bond	However, it's this spoof of all spy and psychedelic series ██████████, the Man from U.N.C.L.E. and the Monkees among others which makes this series worth to watch.
biswas-n	validation	Milo	████ wants Glory back at any price.
biswas-n	validation	Gregory	First, there is very little of Ms. ███████'s book in this script.
biswas-n	testing	Scully	But The XFiles had a good thing going, and ██████ was one of the strongest and most idiosyncratic TV characters of the 90s.
biswas-n	testing	Monroe	██████ died before the movie was completed and it was canned.
biswas-n	testing	Crowe	█████ does Butch one better by blowing them all to pieces.
biswas-n	testing	Zizek	fact that █████ overfocuses on two of the most overrated directors and ones whose films often LACK intelligence, if anything such as Hitchcock and Lynch, only further diminishes his already low credibility.
biswas-n	testing	Dalton	I'm afraid the 1983 ██████ version just doesn't do anything for me.
biswas-n	testing	Keane	You begin to feel █████'s pain and anguish.
biswas-n	testing	Heather Grahm	█████████████ has done much better things since.
biswas-n	testing	Mitchell	Apparently the film takes some liberties with the true facts, but ████████ believed in the power of the airplane in war and wanted an upgrade in air power for the U.S. as well as the creation of an Air Force.
biswas-n	testing	Mermaid	I've seen other Guinea Pig films, like ███████ in a Manhole He Never Dies, and while they're pretty sick, they at least have a bit of a sense of humor to them however dark.
biswas-n	testing	Lew Ayres	█████████, who had just made a name for himself in ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT, stars as a "nice" and "respectable" mob leader.
minhtriet136	training	Calvin	This twisted comedy is well acted and directed. Very funny and the production quality is outstanding. It is easy to see why this short film has been accepted into so many festivals and won awards. Everyone can identify with ██████ having a bad day, bad week, bad life.
minhtriet136	training	Richard Moll	████████████ brings darkness and foreboding that gives this film just the right twistedness. The old man adds to the humor of the story.
minhtriet136	training	Travis Davis	Great performances, excellent camera work and editing---this short is a classic from start to finish. Kudos to ████████████ for pulling double duty as both director and star
minhtriet136	training	Woody Allen	He's the funniest nebbish since ███████████
minhtriet136	training	Richard Moll	And what a treat to see ████████████ back again
minhtriet136	training	Stephen Garvey	This gem of a film showcases the brilliantly funny writing of ██████████████
minhtriet136	training	Steve Garvey	██████████████ is the true current king of quirky comedy.
minhtriet136	training	Suzy Parker	A sincere tribute to ███████████, who's just passed away.
minhtriet136	training	Miss Parker	Not only is TBoE one of the cheesiest movies ever made, but ███████████'s performance is, in this cheesy-movie-lover's opinion, among the worst performances of all time
minhtriet136	training	Joan Crawford	One of █████████████’s last performances as the driven successful editor vs. all those young beautiful eager beavers fresh out of the elite Seven Sister Colleges
minhtriet136	training	Robert Evans	Interesting cameo by ████████████ as a rich cad.
minhtriet136	training	Robert Evans	Here is one of the few films in which once big time producer ████████████
minhtriet136	training	Joan Crawford	It also features a mature █████████████ and terrific supporting cast. Check it out.
minhtriet136	training	Amanda Farrell	Then there's ██████████████ who did succeed professionally, but whose personal life has been sacrificed for an office with her name on the door
minhtriet136	training	Joan Crawford	A classic late 50's film. The superannuated headliners (█████████████ and Louis Jordan) are not at their best, but the direction, cinematography, and acting of the younger cast are compelling.
minhtriet136	training	Suzy Parker	This movie could be called a tearjerker with the saddest part involving ███████████'s character whose obsession of an ex-boyfriend leads to tragedy
minhtriet136	training	Scott Clark	Also interesting is ███████████, who plays Grant, the kid in the wheelchair
minhtriet136	training	Graves	They are also correct that one of the best performances of this movie was that of Dr. ██████
minhtriet136	training	Tex Avery	█████████'s tenure as director of cartoons for MGM was in the 1940s and 50s was one of the brightest moments in cartoon history
minhtriet136	training	Droopy	Throughout the film, despite many insane stunts, ██████ keeps up with this crook until eventually the wolf gives up because ██████ is seemingly everywhere
minhtriet136	training	Tex Avery	This animated short is a remake of one of █████████'s earlier shorts for Fred Quimby at M-G-M
minhtriet136	training	McPoodle	It manages to get most of it's laughs from the shocked reactions Joe has whenever he encounters ████████
minhtriet136	training	Simon Templar	As usual, █████████████ ("The Saint") meets a lady in distress and comes to her aid
minhtriet136	training	Paul Guilfoyle	Along the way, he meets some interesting supporting characters (this time, ██████████████ as "Pearly" Gates) and during his unraveling of this not especially compelling mystery (none of them really are)
minhtriet136	training	George Sanders	██████████████ is once again the consummate sophisticated British do-gooder and he succeeds once again in making an excellent B-detective series film
minhtriet136	training	George Sanders	██████████████ is so charming and, yes, low-key that all that talent, smarts, physical presence and above all, masculinity, seem, well, almost normal
minhtriet136	training	George Clooney	██████████████ can not begin to master the scene as Mr. Sanders does (and does without Mr. Clooney's mugging)
minhtriet136	training	Jonathan Hale	█████████████ simply is Inspector Fernack
minhtriet136	training	Paul Guilfoyle	██████████████ plays a mobster who goes straight (and drinks milk) because he cannot take the pressure
minhtriet136	training	Wendie Barrie	Story begins on an ocean liner headed to the U.S. where the Saint meets but cannot connect with █████████████
minhtriet136	training	Fernack	The Saint assists Inspector ███████ clear his name from a frame
minhtriet136	training	Kristine	I guess since ████████ was of age, it was held against her and her promising career came grinding to a halt
minhtriet136	training	Ronald Reagan	I guess its all in the timing (witness Pam Anderson's career)--but █████████████ was in charge during Kristine's debacle (we had not heard about Nancy Reagan's affairs)
minhtriet136	training	Monica Lewinski	Bill Clinton and ███████████████ were in full swing during Pam's "coming out
minhtriet136	training	Kristine DeBell	I thought ███████████████ was GREAT and was glad to see her move on into some more interesting roles
minhtriet136	training	Steven Spielberg	She's in ████████████████’s "I Wanna Hold Your Hand" and Barbara Streisand's "The Main Event" and Bill Murray's "Meatballs"
minhtriet136	training	Kristine	But her starring role in Alice in Wonderland puts the focus right where it ought to be, right on ████████ as the center of attention
minhtriet136	training	Richard Prior	Fine performances particularly the Kristine DeBell in the lead and was that an unaccredited █████████████ as the prone Knight being vigorously (if discreetly) ridden?
minhtriet136	training	Sacha barren Cohen	i think ██████████████████ was Very and i do mean Very good
minhtriet136	training	Ali	Very intelligent language usage of ███, which you musn't miss! In one word: (eeh sentence...) Wicked, so keep it real and pass it on!
minhtriet136	training	Ali G	The thing with █████ is that he takes the mick out of himself and his character
minhtriet136	training	Sacha Baron Cohen	██████████████████ is a genius
minhtriet136	training	Ali G 	I've liked █████ since the first time I saw the material from the show
minhtriet136	training	Jeff Lieberman	Deborah Benson very good plays the heroine and director ██████████████ created very creepy and dark movie
minhtriet136	training	Jeff Lieberman	██████████████ as a director of this 1981 low budget film does and excellent job and with his other works
minhtriet136	training	Texas Chainsaw Massacre	Even though this is a killer in the woods flick like Friday,it has more in common with the original ███████████████████████
minhtriet136	training	Jeff Lieberman	Director ██████████████ creates terrific atmosphere of dread and despair
minhtriet136	training	Jeff Lieberman	██████████████'s "Just Before Dawn" is definitely one of the most underrated horror movies ever made
minhtriet136	training	Ken Stott	Gripping drama and █████████ was brilliant
minhtriet136	training	DCI Red Metcalfe	Hopefully we have not seen the last of ████████████████.
minhtriet136	validation	Messiah	Although it was scheduled on BBC in three parts I watched ███████ on video in one take
minhtriet136	validation	George Hilton	█████████████ never really grabs me like Franco Nero or Clint Eastwood
minhtriet136	validation	Felipe Martinez	This is the first movie of the director ███████████████ and I really except this movie will be the beginning of a great career as a film director
minhtriet136	validation	Francois Perrin	In French it's narrated by ███████████████, usually good and familiar with beautiful documentaries, but the text is not good at all
minhtriet136	validation	LUC BESSON	Although compared with "Mad Max", this film is in a league of its own. Set in post apocalyptic Paris, this film is about man's struggle for survival, he has lost his ability to speak, and there is a remarkable shortage of women. CONGRATULATIONS ██████████!
minhtriet136	validation	Richard Gere	Diane Lane was wonderful as always, ████████████ isn't an over-actor
minhtriet136	validation	Diane Lane	The chemistry between Richard gere and ██████████e was very believable (fantastic acting on both parts)
minhtriet136	validation	Chris Stokes	I think ████████████ did a pretty good job, considering that is was his first movie.
minhtriet136	validation	Tim Thomerson	Funny guy █████████████ (who steals the show as Blinkin in Robin Hood-Men In Tights) is downright hilarious as the anal retentive Dr. Jekyll and the sex crazed Hyde
minhtriet136	validation	Jekyll and Hyde	At times sophomoric, at others, bitingly satirical and witty, ███████████████ is mostly just a near perfect reflection of the times
minhtriet136	validation	Mel Brookes	███████████ made some remakes of classic films.He made some very strong contributions
minhtriet136	validation	Chaplin	███████ enters the trenches of WWI in this spirited comedy that never belittles the horrors of war
minhtriet136	validation	Dutchess	This movie is about a cat mom named ████████ and her 3 kittens. ████████ and the kittens love music.
minhtriet136	validation	Thomas	██████ gets to love music like the other cats. ██████ and Dutchess really like each other
minhtriet136	validation	William Macy	████████████ is stellar, as always, and Adam Arkin offers one of his better performances
minhtriet136	validation	Fargoesque	It is ██████████, and was a lot of fun to watch. It held my attention all the way through and did not seem to lag at all
minhtriet136	validation	Bill Macy	Not a stunner, but a good movie to see once or twice. █████████ shows he can do more than just act; his writing was pretty darn good
minhtriet136	validation	Jamie Cromwell	Great supporting cast, especially ██████████████ as the extortionist private eye
minhtriet136	validation	Jerry Lundergaard	The movie's greatest strength is the work of Macy, who reminds us of his █████████████████ role from Fargo
minhtriet136	validation	Dennis Quaid	████████████ is supurb as Dexter, a man doomed to die and Meg Ryan excellent as his babe.
minhtriet136	validation	Dennis Quaid	Instead, enjoy a gripping performance from ████████████ and visual imagery to commend.
minhtriet136	validation	Vincent D'Onofrio	Fun, also, to see █████████████████ and Mary-Louise Parker so early in their careers.
minhtriet136	validation	Murphy	If you're a fan of De Niro or ██████, you're going to enjoy this movie.
minhtriet136	validation	DeNiro	██████ and Murphy simply had fun making this movie, so should we (watching it)
minhtriet136	validation	Rene Russo	██████████ also evened out the rest of the cast perfectly, establishing her role so it does not interfere with the budding relationship between De Niro and Murphy.
minhtriet136	validation	Robert De Niro	██████████████ was on top of his game, delivering his lines with such aplomb, one has to believe this is his everyday demeanor
minhtriet136	validation	First Mate	After being discovered by the ██████████ and his henchmen, they were held captive
minhtriet136	validation	Walker and Luke	Shortly after, when ███████████████ are taken to the Sheriff's dept. to being examined by the lies detection machine, things turn out to be very different..
minhtriet136	validation	John Corbett	I find it hard to believe that a judge would change his sentence rendered immediately in the courtroom, even after such a heartfelt speech by the brother (gorgeous ████████████), but overall the story was very gripping
minhtriet136	validation	John Corbett	███████████████ is one of the most talented actors out there, and the guy who played Luke was really good too. Highly recommend.
minhtriet136	testing	Liv Ullmann	I can't wait for the DVD release, as hopefully it will contain comments by ███████████, who will finally explain what she was thinking when she agreed to do this film!
minhtriet136	testing	Sir John Gielgud	Who can forget ████████████████ smiling uneasily in his Dali Lhama outfit, overseeing an interpretive dance to the Republican party ("Family")?
minhtriet136	testing	Bobby Van	And my favourite, █████████ embodying the strength of America's education system
minhtriet136	testing	Liv Ullmann	As for all the reviewers who claimed the cast cannot sing in tune, this criticism falls apart since ███████████, Olivia Hussey and Peter Finch were dubbed
minhtriet136	testing	Lost Horizon	I wouldn't claim for a second that ████████████ is a masterpiece 
minhtriet136	testing	Richard Greico	I thought this was movie was great, ██████████████ and Yasmine Bleeth have great chemistry in this movie
minhtriet136	testing	Keith Richards	As ██████████████ remarks in Paul McCartney's movie about Holly, there's some Buddy Holly in almost all rock made since his day
minhtriet136	testing	Gary Busey	██████████ does a remarkable, energetic portrayal of Holly, and his performances hint that he really gets into the music.
minhtriet136	testing	Gary Busey	The Buddy Holly Story is a great biography with a super performance from ██████████. Busey did his own singing for this film and he does a great job.
minhtriet136	testing	Emanuele Crialese	So if this will not be a real reviveing for the Italian cinema it is an extraordinary evolution for █████████████████ after his 'Respiro' another definitive beautiful film
RamRao	training	Sadako	In Jôji Iida  "Rasen", ██████ explained that the reason behind her curse towards unfortunates was for others to experience pure fear, the same kind of fear she went through all alone at the bottom of a darkened well.
RamRao	training	Sadako	   In Norio Tsuruta  "Bâsudei", the "██████" series continues, except this time we follow a young woman, named ██████(Yukie Nakama), haunted by a ghoulish alter ego with considerable power.
RamRao	training	Hiroshi Tôyama	A sound effects engineer, ██████████████(Seiichi Tanabe), seems to be the only one who accepts her without contention, actually encouraging once she receives the leading role after the actress dies under suspicious, and very unusual, circumstances.
RamRao	training	Sadako	The troupe and crew soon come to the understanding, thanks to a news reporter who instigates a lynch mob after the director(..who initiates a traumatic situation, accusing ██████, an actress he put in position to become a star, of killing the lead actress)is found murdered, his body discovered by a stage hand, that they are accursed(..her photographer  snapshots reveal their distorted faces and other disturbing images).
RamRao	training	Sadako	   A different approach to the "Ringu" series this time making ██████ a sympathetic figure, a young woman tormented by others when, in fact, she is as much a victim as those whose lives are harmed by the vengeful ghoul.
RamRao	training	Sadako	The ghoul is, in a sense, ██████  "protector", a kind of spectre that haunts the theater, and we see how the troupe and crew always respond to our heroine with disdain and disregard.
RamRao	training	Sadako	Tôyama becomes her sole friend and confident and their blossoming romance is the heart and soul of "Ringu 0-Birthday", as he attempts to rescue her from all those that find ██████ a threat..to no avail.
RamRao	training	Sadako	"Bâsudei" actually has two major climaxes, the theatrical production which spirals out of control when it should've been ██████  finest hour on stage, and the discovery of where Ikuma had been hiding the alter ego, the lynch mob, behind an attack on our heroine, coming in contact, face-to-face with a fate worse than death.
RamRao	training	Ikuma	Potent finale, reiterating what I mentioned in the opening sentence of my user comment, as we witness █████  decision to "end all of it" in regards to Sadako.
RamRao	training	Nolte	All logic is thrown into the wind, and the viewer  intelligence is insulted and pounded upon repeatedly with more force than that baseball bat could ever have generated - the one used by █████ and McGregor.
RamRao	training	Nolte	█████ was molesting corpses decades earlier and the writers of this film would have us believe that this man could years later become the city  chief police investigator
RamRao	training	Thomas Edison	Making him the killer is as absurd as giving █████████████ credit for inventing the wheel, as laughable as a conspiracy-theory plot from the "X-Files", and as stupid as Kim Basinger  book on how to solve all of world  problems (if she'd ever write one).
RamRao	training	Nolte	This is an essential piece of the puzzle that is badly missing here; McGregor JUST HAPPENS to get a job where he meets █████.
RamRao	training	Brolin	And McGregor  best friend, ██████, JUST HAPPENS to know a prostitute who is Nolte  play toy (and later victim).
RamRao	training	Brolin	And to add some silliness, ██████ is some kind of a deranged thrill-seeker who acts like a total lunatic all the time.
RamRao	training	Brolin	And how the hell did ██████ get into the mortuary when he carried out his "practical joke"?
RamRao	training	Nolte	And how the hell did █████ manage to drag out a body of one of his victims within seconds of McGregor entering the room, without McGregor noticing it (the fact that he had his walkman on and/or was singing and/or talking doesn't make it any more believable)?
RamRao	training	Nolte	And what  with this annoying scene where Arquette JUST HAPPENS to walk into the mortuary at exactly the moment when McGregor is hitting █████ with a baseball bat and predictably starts thinking her boyfriend is the killer??
RamRao	training	Brolin	More annoyances came from the scene in which ██████  reaction to McGregor  telling him that the latter is been suspected of murder is to laugh
RamRao	training	Sadako	 This movie focuses on how ██████ becomes the murdering spirit.
RamRao	training	Sadako	This sort of ruins the image of the evil ██████ spirit we know from the other Ringu movies.
RamRao	training	Hannibal Rising	In that regard this movie suffers from the same problem as "███████████████".
RamRao	training	Sadako	For instance I never saw ██████ as a young adult but more as a 12 year old child or so.
RamRao	training	Carrie	You can see this movie as "Ringu" meets "██████", since this movie story- and character-wise definitely show some similarities to the Brian De Palma horror classic "██████", from 1976.
RamRao	training	Sadako	The film fleshes out the back story of the Ring trilogies' demon / troubled soul, ██████, (played by Yukie Nakama), following her attempts to join an acting troupe and at the same time cope with her troubled psyche and the events of her mysterious past that still engulf her.
RamRao	training	Sadako	 The film itself has a fundamentally creepy atmosphere throughout but as with many prequels never really equals the original story, in this case never really delivering the same level of suspense, (although it does come close a couple of times), and failing to shock in the way the original did with ██████ being a silent Reagan, (The Exorcist), type character staring at you hatefully through a horrifically blood shot eye, peering through a nest of slimy, sinister, long black hair.
RamRao	training	Sadako	This sees a lot of the scenes shot inside a theatre, which provides a suitably eerie backdrop for ██████  doomed quest to lead a normal life and battle the demons of her past that lurk ever closer.
RamRao	training	Sadako	 With regards to filling in the blanks left open in Ring and Ring 2, this film does very little, for we are already aware that ██████ was pushed to the bottom of the well by her step father, and only hints at the source of the true evil lurking inside her, without giving a clue of its origin or past.
RamRao	training	Seiichi Tanabe	 The actors do a reasonably good job throughout, with a special hats off to ██████████████ who conveyed the confused yet blindly in love hero Tôyama.
RamRao	training	Nakama	██████ brought a certain level of pity to the role of Sadako, a girl seemingly running away from the evil that surrounds and trying to do the right thing.
RamRao	training	Graham Norton	Ireland may have given the world hurling, green beer, █████████████, and that funny dancing where the arms don't move, but it isn't exactly renowned for its horror movies.
RamRao	training	Paddy Breathnach	Shrooms, a psychological chiller from director ████████████████, is unlikely to change that fact.
RamRao	training	Breathnach	 Rather than tell a straightforward scary story, ██████████ unwisely chooses to blur the line between what is reality and what is merely a figment of a drug-addled mind.
RamRao	training	Boyd	The chemistry between ████ and Wolheim worked and the film managed to be quite entertaining.
RamRao	training	Harold Lloyd	Oddly, however, the film managed to beat out ████████████  film, SPEEDY, for an Oscar for Best Direction for a Comedy (a category no longer used)--as SPEEDY was a superior film in most ways (it  one of Lloyd  best films).
RamRao	training	Louis Walheim	 By the way, director Milestone and █████████████ would team up just a few years later for another WWI picture, the great ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT--a film that is definitely NOT a comedy.
RamRao	training	Simon Cowell	Created by ████████████ of American Idol fame, AGT is a talent search show which is similar in format to American Idol and the Gong Show.
RamRao	training	Mr. Koji	Since this movie is an adaptation of ████████ Suzuki  Lemonheart which is among the 3 stories contained in Ringu 0: Baasudei that was released in 1999, it  sufficient say that the director did pretty well with altering some of its contents to suit the interpretation of the previous movies (Ringu and Ringu 2) which was also unparalleled.
RamRao	training	Sadako	I don't think the storyline was confusing at all since it mostly concentrated on ██████  life (Derived from Lemonheart) and doesn't really focus on the curse of the video tape.
RamRao	training	Sadako	 What I truly love about this movie is the fact that they wanted us to feel sympathetic towards ██████  character albeit the wickedness of what we see in Ringu and Ringu 2.
RamRao	training	Yukie Nakama	Bravo to ████████████ for portraying Sadako  character effectively.
RamRao	training	Sadako	It  designed to tell us the tragic story of ██████  life before the cursed video tape, which exceeded from my own expectations.
RamRao	training	Nakata Hideo	 I can see why many are baffled by the story since the one who directed this is not ████████████ and obviously lingered a bit from the previous adaptations (I guess you might say more on the book than Ringu and Ringu 2.).
RamRao	training	Katharine	He meets a female fighter, █████████, who appears to be homeless but who can fight and defeat men twice her size.
RamRao	training	Dublin	The two eventually team up, but ██████  somewhat sleazy past catches up with them, causing conflict, pain, and emotional distress for both.
RamRao	training	Nick Nolte	 Perhaps ██████████  worst role EVER.
RamRao	training	Josh Brolin	Ewan McGregor just looks embarrassed, as do ███████████ and Patricia Arquette.
RamRao	training	Simon	█████ Cowell manages to try another spin-off of "American Idol", despite of the failure with his previous attempt "American Inventor".
RamRao	training	Cowell	Even more, giving it is an open talent contest, half of them are singers what gives ██████ a chance for a shot closer to the "Idol" success.
RamRao	training	Philbin	 Regis ███████ does his job, he always manages to look as a nice guy, I don't think he contributes rising the show interest but is not responsible for the poor overcome either.
RamRao	validation	David Hasselhoff	 Let me start by ████████████████ just because he is the only I know.
RamRao	validation	Piers Morgan	 ████████████, who I don't have any clue who he is, takes the role of the wise and balanced judge completing his stereotype with a British accent that in America seems -wrongfully- to be synonymous of a higher intellect.
RamRao	validation	Brandy	 Finally ██████.
RamRao	validation	Brandy	At some point I felt bad for Morgan whose face seems ██████ preferred target for the uncontrollable spin of her arms and her annoying affection demonstrations.
RamRao	validation	Cowell	 In his modesty ██████ doesn't realize that the success of his shows is linked to him being in front the cameras rather than behind them.
RamRao	validation	Simon	If █████ were in this show not even the contestants would be necessary to nail its success.
RamRao	validation	Young Sadako	████████████ is part of a theater troupe, and a reporter knows who she is but the rest of the cast doesn't, at least, not yet.
RamRao	validation	Sadako	There are glimpses of ██████  strange powers, which she can't seem to control when she  threatened.
RamRao	validation	Sadako	██████ then ends up with the leading role in the play but when the meddling reporter slips a tape in that isn't meant to be part of the play, it changes everything and ██████  telekinetic powers are unleashed on the unsuspecting audience and cast, but stopped just short of harm to anyone....except, herself.
RamRao	validation	Ringu	 Just a warning though; it is slow paced, even more so than █████, a complaint many people seem to have with these movies, and the first time i watched it i wasn't sure if it was leading anywhere.
RamRao	validation	Sadako	██████ Yamamura is part of an acting school, and her first role is a few days away.
RamRao	validation	Sadako	The story also follows a journalist who has traced down ██████, she is the widow of a man who died, also under mysterious circumstances at the hands of, she believes, ██████  estranged mother.
RamRao	validation	Sadako	██████  mother was famed for her supposed supernatural abilities, and killed herself a short while ago.
RamRao	validation	Sadako	The journalist wants to find out the truth, and finds ██████ just before opening night.
RamRao	validation	Sadako	Paying one of the jealous girls to mess with the audio equipment, hoping to get a reaction from ██████, much like Hamlet, the play begins to go wrong, and in a Carrie-like scene, everyone blames ██████.
RamRao	validation	Yukie Nakama	The acting has been very good from everyone, especially ████████████, who is gorgeous, and drags out our sympathy.
RamRao	validation	Sadako	Toyama is the only person who trusts ██████, and tries to defend her, eventually leading to one of the most tragic scenes in movie history.
RamRao	validation	Sadako	Every scene is shot trying to balance beauty with the creation of fear, a wonderful irony considering ██████  own birth and life- She doesn't want to hurt anyone, and is capable of great beauty, but all she seems to do is scare and kill.
RamRao	validation	Sadako	 I've probably hyped the film too much now, but the final scenes in the forest and ██████  old home are really that good.
RamRao	validation	Sadako	The point is, the questions are there to be asked, for us to work them out ourselves- we become like the journalists in each of the movies, drawing ourselves closer into the tragedy and threat of ██████  life until we cannot escape.
RamRao	validation	Mr. Knotts	After his stagecoach is held up, ██████████ joins a wagon train.
RamRao	validation	Barbara Rhoades	He plays horsey with buxom ███████████████ (as Penelope Cushings) and dresses up as a fetching Indian squaw.
RamRao	validation	Knotts	Is ██████' character bisexual?
RamRao	validation	Vic Mizzy	█████████  wild, wild western music resembles his own "Green Acres".
RamRao	validation	Bob Hope	All in all, this is a tedious, uncalled for re-make of ████████  "The Paleface" (1948).
RamRao	validation	Sadako Yamamura	 Where ███████████████ is early in her college experience, and dealing with the typical issues of trying to succeed in her love for theater, and her romantic life.
RamRao	validation	Howard Hughes	Was this an early variation of beefcake courtesy of █████████████?
RamRao	validation	Nestor Almendros	Was the DP trying to emulate the work of ████████████████ on DAYS OF HEAVEN by shooting only ambient lighting?
RamRao	validation	Sadako Yamamura	And in "Ringu 0" (2000), the prequel to the original, we get to see the face of ███████████████, heretofore mostly hidden behind long, stringy hair, and, as played by actress Yukie Nakama, it is quite a lovely face indeed.
RamRao	validation	Sadako	We also get to discover some of ██████  back story, and learn what she was up to 30 years before she began slaying via videotape.
RamRao	testing	Carrie White	Compared to ████████████ in the 1976 film "Carrie," Sadako is far nastier, and just like in that earlier film, all heck breaks loose following an instigated public freakout.
RamRao	testing	Sadako	"Ringu 0" is a fairly slow-moving film, and a surprise revelation concerning ██████ that comes halfway through is very hard to swallow.
RamRao	testing	Sadako Yamamura	Shortly after an oddly quiet young woman, ███████████████ (Yukie Nakama), joins a drama troupe, strange events, including deaths with suspicious circumstances, start occurring.
RamRao	testing	Sadako	Is ██████ somehow connected to these events?
RamRao	testing	Sadako	The horror stuff generally works, although ██████ would have benefited from not having so many functions.
RamRao	testing	Hiroshi Takahashi	 The script, by █████████████████, from a story by Ring novelist Koji Suzuki, is admirable on an artistic level.
RamRao	testing	Norio Tsuruta	 The problem is that director █████████████ just cannot get much momentum going with the material.
RamRao	testing	Sadako	There are glimpses, through ██████ or around her, of a more intriguing world, but they're often little more than "flashes" that might cause us to do a double take.
RamRao	testing	Tsuruta	Takahashi and ███████ work hard to establish a romance subplot involving a love triangle (or two), but this can barely get off the ground.
RamRao	testing	Shoko Miyaji	 I would have preferred a stronger focus on ████████████ (Yoshiko Tanaka), the reporter who is trying to investigate the psychic demonstration tragedy.
nithyasokkula2204	training	Paul	It's a little hard to cope with the fact that the hammerhead shark that's killing everybody is constantly being called "████".
nithyasokkula2204	training	William Forsythe	Also, ████████████████'s cast as a MacGyver-kick-ass-savingtheday- kinda hero lacks credibility.
nithyasokkula2204	training	Paul	On the other hand there are a few hot chicks who make you actually look at the screen while shark ████ bites another one to death.
nithyasokkula2204	training	Charlotte	When █████████ and Veronica get close to intimacy is a beautiful, low key, truly erotic scene.
nithyasokkula2204	training	Veronica	I thought the male actor portraying ████████ was okay but no better than that.
nithyasokkula2204	training	Charlotte	Much better was the woman portraying █████████, a very complex character full of energy, self-loathing, desire and contradictions.
nithyasokkula2204	training	John Cale	Furthermore, both Tak Fujimoto's vibrant cinematography and █████████'s marvelously dolorous oddball blues score are 100% on the money excellent.
nithyasokkula2204	training	Boll	nope ████ just thought to throw it in to upset animal lovers.. whatever.
nithyasokkula2204	training	Linda	Who the puck cares about █████'s 4 part surgery.
nithyasokkula2204	training	Tom Long	I can only assume that he was cast for the role of ████████ on the strength of his excellent acting in "The Choir".
nithyasokkula2204	training	Lebowski	And The Big ████████ was hysterical!
nithyasokkula2204	training	Frederic March	The movie begins well enough, as ██████████████ (a fine actor) is in the lead.
nithyasokkula2204	training	Murry Lerner	I don't know if director ████████████ is just not a Who fan, or worse, for him at least, if he *is* a Who fan and this is all the *eight* cameras could deliver for him.
nithyasokkula2204	training	Lesley	██████ Anne-Down is the lovely leading lady, stumbling upon a lost treasure – it’s actually been hidden away by a local sect to prevent it from falling into the hands of foreigners, who have appropriated much of the country’s heritage (under the pretext of culture) for far too long.
nithyasokkula2204	training	Jessica Stein	Far better than Kissing █████████████, a good choice if your tired of watching gay movies that have some painful lesson and bitter lesson.
nithyasokkula2204	training	James Earl Jones	of State are killed when a building collapses, and the Vice President had had a stroke a month earlier, so the Oval office falls to a token black staffmember (played by ████████████████).
nithyasokkula2204	training	Cheney	This coincidence seems even more plausible today considering recent terrorism and the health of current Vice President ██████.
nithyasokkula2204	training	Wallace	Serling's unsentimental script (based on Irving ███████'s book) includes intrigue and plot twists, and the amazing confluence of recognizable character actors under effective direction transcend the usual TV movie standards, making this one of the better TV movies I've ever seen.
nithyasokkula2204	training	Andy Goldsworthy	It had an overall meditative quality from the music, to the beautiful photography, and listening to the often cliché things about life that ████████████████ would say as he worked or in between shots.
nithyasokkula2204	training	Slasher Cinema	This is truly banal cinema on a Brobdingnagian scale!I have this film on the "██████████████" box-set with some other films.
nithyasokkula2204	training	Craze	From what I can gather, █████ seemed to be about the crazy antiques dealer who prays to an African statue and sacrifices people to it.
nithyasokkula2204	training	Lohan	The casting was well directed and miss █████ does suck you in the movie with her well known attitude and an unsuspected self-cynical humor.
nithyasokkula2204	training	Dan Castellanetta	I remember having a Megavolt action figure, I don't remember what happened to him, but when I found out he was voiced by █████████████████ (Homer Simpson), I really, really wanted that action figure back!
nithyasokkula2204	training	Inman	too clean (and well-fitting, especially her father's old hat and coat in the scene where █████ comes home) for any sense of accuracy.
nithyasokkula2204	training	Elaine	My reaction to that one was the same as ██████'s on Seinfeld: "It sucked.
nithyasokkula2204	training	Orfevres	Quai des ████████ is all of these, but more than anything else it's an amusing comedy of infidelity, jealousy and love, set in post-WWII Paris.
nithyasokkula2204	training	Hitchcock	In this I share █████████'s view, which says, 'A murder mystery is a slice of cake with raisins and candied fruit, and if you deny yourself this, you might as well film a documentary.'"
nithyasokkula2204	training	Orfevres	Quai des ████████ is a wonderful film, and it's no documentary.
nithyasokkula2204	training	Jenny Latour	Her stage name is ████████████.
nithyasokkula2204	training	Martineau	█████████ is something of a sad sack.
nithyasokkula2204	training	Rita Hayworth	She's blond, gorgeous (think of █████████████) and capable.
nithyasokkula2204	training	Martineau	She and █████████ have been friends since they were children together.
nithyasokkula2204	training	Antoine	Inspector ███████ gets the case.
nithyasokkula2204	training	Louis Jouvet	Antoine (████████████) is a tall, tired, middle-aged bachelor with sore feet.
nithyasokkula2204	training	Antoine	One of the first things ███████ discovers is not only did someone brain Brignon with a bottle, someone shot him in the heart.
nithyasokkula2204	training	Jenny Latour	Will we have a chance to see some great music hall songs sung by ████████████?
nithyasokkula2204	training	Detective Antoine	Everything becomes clear, but only with time and █████████████████'s persistence.
nithyasokkula2204	training	Jenny Latour	Most of all, he takes us to the music hall where ████████████ often performs.
nithyasokkula2204	training	Jenny	We can see █████ as she sings, with couples in the seats and single men wearing their coats and hats in standing room.
nithyasokkula2204	training	Jouvet	██████ was tall with a long face and broad cheekbones.
nithyasokkula2204	training	Miss Dora Monnier	At one point he says, "I've taken a liking to you, █████████████████."
nithyasokkula2204	training	Ally McBeal	Jouvet brings all kinds of nuances to that line, from rueful regret to a gentle amusement.True, the idea for this TV series may have sprung from the immense success which ███████████ is enjoying worldwide, even here in Germany.
nithyasokkula2204	training	Rebecca Immanuel	), played by charming ████████████████, exchange quick romantic repartees and continually spy on each other while engaging in sitcom-like criminal cases in Berlin and surroundings.
nithyasokkula2204	training	Isabel Tuengerthal	Further, they are aided by a magnificent cast of co-stars, most notably their secretary, played by ██████████████████, who is a rare gem with GREAT comic potential.
nithyasokkula2204	training	Jim Carrey	I saw the cover, and figured, "Oh, it's got ██████████, it must be at least marginally funny."
nithyasokkula2204	training	Rick Marshall	Will Ferrel plays █████████████, a scientist who believe tachyons, or sub-atomic particles, can cross time and dimension rifts.
nithyasokkula2204	training	Jim Carrey	Not only is ██████████ (or anyone else in this movie) not even remotely funny, but he's not even the main character.
nithyasokkula2204	training	Myrick	Still, it seems that ██████ had enough time on his hands to hatch a few cinematic eggs.
nithyasokkula2204	training	Brad Silberling	The script itself, along with ███████████████'s direction is the trump card, though.
nithyasokkula2204	training	David Vaughn	Subsequently, ████████████ and his partner Victor are abducted by a bunch of weirdos who take them inside an old bunker where their fellow cult members reside.
nithyasokkula2204	validation	Victor	A lot of hokey acting is involved in that process and finally culminates in a scene where ██████ gets to bang a hot cult member chick.
nithyasokkula2204	training	Craig Sheffer	For one, █████████████ is not a likable hero.
nithyasokkula2204	validation	Wilfred Brimley	And, unlike other reviewers, I don't find ███████████████'s narration annoying or distracting.
nithyasokkula2204	validation	Melissa Joan Hart	But the acting is amazing and █████████████████ is as cute as a button.
nithyasokkula2204	validation	Salem	Harvey and Sabrina make a really cute couple and █████ is absolutely hilarious.
nithyasokkula2204	validation	John Millius	He hasn't quite achieved true greatness yet, but one day he may just break through.On the 99th anniversary of the Spanish American war and the most famous land battle of that brief said war, ████████████ wrote and directed a stirring tribute to the First Volunteer Cavalry.
nithyasokkula2204	validation	Morgan	I'm not really a fan of some of the seventh season twists... Once you get to college, ██████ joins the group and her dialog is painful and very poorly acted... Plus she is ugly, so the jokes about how she is only surviving off her good looks were lost on me...
nithyasokkula2204	validation	Ito Misaki	Soon, it seems that a lot of countries are reluctant to accept any more due to the sudden influx of Japanese in their country and the chaos that follows (if this ever happens, touch-wood, I hope ██████████ will be safe... she can always stay at my place... hee hee).
nithyasokkula2204	validation	Toyokawa Etsushi	Dr.Tadokoro (played by ████████████████) was done really well, portraying a divorced and often mad scientist who kicks and bashes up stuff.
nithyasokkula2204	validation	Shibasaki Kou	Reiko (played by gorgeous █████████████) was also played rather well, and has the most memorable line in the entire movie (go watch it to find out) and I fancy that she has a nice acting voice.
nithyasokkula2204	validation	Captain Wentworth	They had poor Anne chasing up and down the streets after █████████████████ like a silly modern adolescent (and if you happen to be a silly modern adolescent reading this, let me tell you: running after a male like a female in heat is NOT cool).
nithyasokkula2204	validation	Roosevelt	Some may find █████████ too super-patriotic, even too racist in some regards.
nithyasokkula2204	validation	Jon Fedele	This time, it is painfully obvious Morty is a man (actor ██████████) in a fake looking suit.
nithyasokkula2204	validation	Vampiros Lesbos	Franco is best known (although 'known' might be slightly exaggerated) for "███████████████", a weird cultish movie that got more acclaim in the mid 90's when people found out Jess Franco was also an interesting composer.
nithyasokkula2204	validation	Franco	Since that moment ██████ never could grip me that much.
nithyasokkula2204	validation	Vampiros Lesbos	It is even better than "███████████████", I think.
nithyasokkula2204	validation	Vampiros Lesbos	Remember, I had seen "███████████████" before (although chronologically that came only three years later) and both movies kinda start the same.
nithyasokkula2204	validation	Godard	But then the story went on, puzzling and gripping, beautiful camera work and the stuff you would like to see ██████ do if he weren't so occupied with spreading his political messages.
nithyasokkula2204	validation	Marilyn Monroe	She recreated ██████████████'s poses for the magazine and I wanted to see the movie because of it.
nithyasokkula2204	validation	Marilyn	You know him, he's the guy who claimed to have been ███████'s confidant and husband for about a weekend.
nithyasokkula2204	validation	Miss Monroe	All his claims were never proved as a matter of fact his marriage claim was totally disproven when a check dated at the same time of their wedding and signed by ███████████ proved that she was in Los Angeles at the time.
nithyasokkula2204	validation	Fu Manchu	For example, there is the scene where █████████ is confused which henchman is which in which he says "Ah, you all look the same to me."
nithyasokkula2204	validation	Mencia	Otherwise, you're better off settling on chewing aluminum foil.Carlos ██████ is not funny.
nithyasokkula2204	validation	Carlos Mencia	From his stand up specials to this train wreck of a TV series, █████████████ is not funny.
nithyasokkula2204	validation	Ashton Kutcher	I would liked that the protagonist male character were given to ██████████████, however, the film is good.Oh my GOD this was so bad!
nithyasokkula2204	validation	Carlos Mencia	Comedy stands no chance of evolving with █████████████ around.
nithyasokkula2204	validation	Carlos Mencia	Perhaps people, especially viewers and Comedy Central executives will get the point since this week's issue of "New York" magazine accurately labeled him: "█████████████, unrepentant joke-filcher.
nithyasokkula2204	validation	Daffy	The short starts with █████ getting frustrated at only being typecast in comedy, and reads HIS version of the classic to the producer.
nithyasokkula2204	validation	Errol Flynn	The rest is a roller-coaster of priceless performances from the toons, swashbuckling and sight gags complete with references to ███████████, with an unexpected ending to boot.
nithyasokkula2204	validation	Sylvester	Porky is given little to do but does what he can with The Lord High Chamberlain, while █████████ relishes his part as the Duke.
nithyasokkula2204	testing	Melissa	Also ███████ is a very beautiful and cute duck I think.
nithyasokkula2204	testing	Clancy B. Grass	The direction, music, and print color are very good as well as the opening theme song performed by ███████████████, III.
nithyasokkula2204	testing	Marine Corp	is as accurate a portrayal to date depicting ███████████ boot camp and how boys are turned into men.
nithyasokkula2204	testing	Jack	████ Webb is excellent as Sgt.Jim Moore, a tough, but fair drill instructor in Paris Island North Carolina.
nithyasokkula2204	testing	Full Metal Jacket	A more recent film, █████████████████, also shows life in basic training and is well worth viewing.Nothing will ruin a movie as much as the combination of a poor script and poor direction.
nithyasokkula2204	testing	Ricci	Christina █████, always watchable, is given little in the script to support her nutty character.
nithyasokkula2204	testing	Tarantino	█████████ took old action movies from the seventies and copied everything about them.
nithyasokkula2204	testing	Kill Bill	More than that, I was offended that I was led to believe that I was going to see an actually good movie, which █████████ is not.I couldn't bear to sit through he entire movie.
nithyasokkula2204	testing	Amitabh Bachchan	But what makes 'Eklavya' a tad different is just one name  ████████████████.
nithyasokkula2204	testing	Linda Carter	The main draw to this one was to see ████████████ (Wonder Woman) out of that curve hugging outfit with her chest free to grace the screen.
vudu0001	training	Ken Burns	Is it with the great interest and depth of a █████████ documentary?
vudu0001	training	Borowcyzk	Who can say, but despite Mr █████████'s taste for vivid
vudu0001	training	David Zucker	BASEketball is indeed a really funny movie ████████████ manages to make us all laugh our heads off again
vudu0001	training	Jim Morris	This is a movie that plays to everyone's emotions We all want a second chance at things ██████████ got one

vudu0001	testing	Lugosi	how the heck did ██████ get out of cabs without being seen?

vudu0001	testing	Temuera	the scene where ███████ is procreating inside the house while a battle rages outside is just too stupid for words.
vudu0001	testing	Andrew Gurland	██████████████ is a hack, avoid or burn.
vudu0001	testing	Gerardo	The best scene in the movie was when ███████ is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head.
bhargavvummadi	training	Barbara	 The soundtrack is torturous, featuring ███████ belting out some of the weakest blather ever put to film.
bhargavvummadi	training	Jack Bender	 If ███████████ continues with this episode from the season premiere, he would have kept it in a good pace and keep things float to keep things interesting.
bhargavvummadi	training	Jack Bender	 I'm glad ███████████ is directing next week's episode and it'll be much better and I'm glad he got first Syaid episode to direct and I'm curious what he will pull off this time since Stephen Williams had directed too many Syaid episodes before.

bhargavvummadi	training	Richard Dawson	 ██████████████ deserved to win Best Supporting Actor! A I D S My favorite line from the movie was "That hit the spot" A I D S.
bhargavvummadi	training	Anne Rice	 I thought it'd be impossible for any █████████ book-turned film to be worse than EXIT TO EDEN, but FEAST OF ALL SAINTS makes that mess look like a critical hit. 
bhargavvummadi	training	Walsh	 █████ and Flynn teamed in quite often afterward, and "They Died with Their Boots On" reunited Olivia de Havilland as Flynn's romantic interest for the last time.

bhargavvummadi	training	Libby	 Eventually, █████ intercedes on his behalf with General Sheridan, who was in command of the army, and gets him back on active duty as the commander of the 7th Cavalry.
bhargavvummadi	training	Max Steiner	 "They Died with Their Boots On" benefits from a top-notch ███████████ score that incorporates the regimental tune "Gary Owen.
bhargavvummadi	training	Kevin Bacon	 However, on a brighter note, I have managed to successfully do the 6 degrees of ███████████ from this movie, so I think it was almost worthwhile watching the 91 minutes of it.
bhargavvummadi	training	Amuro Ray	 Their target, a new Gundam being built exclusively for Newtypes (supposedly built for █████████ from the original Gundam saga) inside.
bhargavvummadi	training	Bernie	 Through the show, ██████ acts as a father figure to Al (whose real father is always working) and seems to be taken with Federation pilot Christina McKenzie, but eventually they must meet.
bhargavvummadi	training	Bette Midler	████████████ is simply superb as Mama Rose.
bhargavvummadi	training	Michael Stearns	███████████████ plays Mike, a sexually frustrated individual with an interesting moral attitude towards sexuality.
bhargavvummadi	training	Christine Ebersoll	 The other actors are also fine,particularly ██████████████████ as Tessie.
bhargavvummadi	training	Joe Chamberlain	 The clipping is forty years old and it refers to ███████████████ and the Boer War rather than Neville in the current crisis.
bhargavvummadi	training	Stan Laurel	 I can see ███████████ making the same mistake.
bhargavvummadi	training	Alain Delon	 This unhinged French production is a stew of perplexedly unfocused ideas and random plot illustrations centred on its very charismatic stars (if somewhat anti-heroes) ███████████ and Charles Bronson.
bhargavvummadi	training	Bernard Fresson	 ███████████████ chalks up the attitude as the Inspector who knows there's more going on than what is being led on.
bhargavvummadi	training	Jim Brown	 █████████ will be forever remembered as one of the greatest football players to ever play the game.
bhargavvummadi	training	Rolf Bayer	 I am not sure who ██████████ was.

bhargavvummadi	training	Jan Rosenberg	The apolitical musicians Eva (Liv Ullmann) and ████████████ (Max von Sydow) have been married for seven years and live in a small farm in a remote island to escape from a civil war in the continent.
bhargavvummadi	training	Jacobi	 When Colonel ██████ (Gunnar Björnstrand) stalks Eva, Jan changes his behavior and becomes a brutal man, and the love and affection they feel for each other change to hatred and indifference.
bhargavvummadi	training	Bob Townsend	 After ███████████ (Lester Vail - a poor man's Johnny Mack Brown) offers to do the "right thing" and marry her - they had just spent a night together when Bonnie declared (with abandon) that she wants love on approval - she starts to show some character by deciding to get a job.
bhargavvummadi	training	Jake Luva	 She is thrilled for him but soon realises it is bootlegging and he is mixed up with cold blooded killer, █████████ (Clark Gable).
bhargavvummadi	training	Bert	 He is then forced to kill ████ and after- wards he goes into hiding.
bhargavvummadi	training	Bonnie	 The paper pulls out all stops in an effort to find Bert's killer and sends ██████ undercover as a dancer in one of Jake's clubs.
bhargavvummadi	training	William Bakewell	 ████████████████ had a huge career (he had started as a teenager in a Douglas Fairbanks film in the mid 20s).
bhargavvummadi	training	Douglas Fairbanks	 William Bakewell had a huge career (he had started as a teenager in a █████████████████ film in the mid 20s).
bhargavvummadi	training	Joan Crawford	 In this film he played the weak brother and was completely over-shadowed by █████████████ and the dynamic newcomer Clark Gable - maybe that was why he never became a star.

bhargavvummadi	training	Alan Rickman	 Still, ████████████ should have gotten an Oscar nomination for his multi-dimensional performance, no doubt about it.
bhargavvummadi	training	Aimee Brooks	 There are hilarious scenes, ████████████ is extremely sexy and this film really entertains.
bhargavvummadi	training	Charles Bateman	 TV veteran ███████████████ is the star and "Enter the Dragon" beauty Ahna Capri is his girlfriend.

bhargavvummadi	training	Shakespeare	 So does ███████████ and Dante.
bhargavvummadi	training	Jim Carrey	 ██████████ was clearly just sleepwalking through his performance and he didn't even seem to be trying.
bhargavvummadi	training	Virginia Madsen	 ███████████████ did the best she could with a limited role but she needs to pick better scripts.
bhargavvummadi	training	Rob	 Truly great shows are still funny after many, repeated viewings, like, "the one where ███ gets accidentally hypnotized", on the "Dick Van Dyke Show", or "the one where Lucy and Ethel work at the candy factory.
bhargavvummadi	training	Dane Cook	 I have to let you know, I'm not a huge fan of either █████████ or Steve Carell, so I really had no expectations going into this.
bhargavvummadi	validation	Shirley Knight	 ██████████████ has a complex, diverging role and there are moments of some awe-inspiring acting by her.
bhargavvummadi	validation	James Caan	 It's also kind of a shame that ██████████ went on to be typecast as the 'tough guy' for the rest of his career, because this film evidenced that he is capable of so much more than that.
bhargavvummadi	validation	Ashton Kutcher	 The fact that this pile of garbage is capped off with ██████████████ bending his boss over and taking his pants off in front of everybody just makes this movie ever worse.
bhargavvummadi	validation	Jacqueline McKenzie	If ███████████████████ and John Lynch weren't such talented actors this film would probably be even worse than it actually is.
bhargavvummadi	validation	John Lynch	If Jacqueline McKenzie and ██████████ weren't such talented actors this film would probably be even worse than it actually is.
bhargavvummadi	validation	Terry Gilliam	█████████████ traveled again to the future (he had already done it in "Brazil") to tell this story about a virus that's destroying the human race.
bhargavvummadi	validation	Bruce Willis	 As for the cast, ████████████ and the beautiful Madeleine Stowe (whatever happened to her??) are just OK, but Brad Pitt is so annoying, whenever he plays roles that are out of his hand he results so forced and he's not credible at all.

bhargavvummadi	validation	Kurt Angle	██████████ did some really good wrestling moves and proves he is the best wrestler out of the match.
bhargavvummadi	validation	Randy Orton	 Good match,surprising heat for ███████████ who was the face in this match.
bhargavvummadi	validation	Walter Pidgeon	Disappointing film with ██████████████ as a hunter who goes to Germany to assassinate Hitler.
bhargavvummadi	validation	George Sanders	 Pidgeon is pursued back to England by the evil ██████████████ and his cohort, John Carradine, who speaks little, but is again as always, the embodiment of wickedness personified.
bhargavvummadi	validation	Oliver Reed	 ███████████ was a great actor and he proves it in Oliver! The other actors and actresses, especially Ron Moody and Shani Wallis, are equally wonderful and offer powerful portrayals of characters who evoke sympathy and warmth without being caricatures.

bhargavvummadi	validation	Rosario Dawson	 Acting wise, ██████████████ is really good and almost conveys portraying someone almost a decade younger (a teenager in other words).
bhargavvummadi	validation	Doug McClure	████████████ has starred in a few of these British produced genre adventures and this one has got to be the worst of the lot.
bhargavvummadi	validation	Ben	 Since Hank was ███ and Jo's kid I cared about him too; it's not like he was a brat or anything.

bhargavvummadi	validation	Rose McGowan	 So when I found out that ████████████ was doing a Ten Little Indians type of movie I knew that I was in for a treat.
bhargavvummadi	validation	Mary Pickford	█████████████ often stated that Tess Skinner was her favorite movie role.
bhargavvummadi	validation	Adolph Zukor	 Well said! She played the part twice and for this version which she herself produced, she not only had to purchase the rights from ████████████ but even give him credit on the film's main title card.
bhargavvummadi	validation	Lloyd Hughes	 She married ████████████ in 1921 and retired in 1926 to devote her life completely to her husband and their two children.
bhargavvummadi	validation	Mike Connors	 ████████████ and Richard Denning brought some life to the film, but even they could not lift this film into the category where you could say- 'I enjoyed that film' Richard Denning's acting career began in 1937.

bhargavvummadi	testing	James	 Strangely, this fact comes out only toward the very end, when Sally's brother █████ is understandbly furious at her blase announcement that she is carrying Jefferson's child.
bhargavvummadi	testing	Jefferson	 █████████ is equally blase when told that Sally is carrying his child, and patronizingly tells her that she'd be far better off under his protection than free and living in France with her brother.
bhargavvummadi	testing	John Wood	 █████████ is very funny as 'Finkel', Byers' ever-so English butler.
bhargavvummadi	testing	William Hurt	████████████ may not be an American matinee idol anymore, but he still has pretty good taste in B-movie projects.
bhargavvummadi	testing	Angela Lansbury	Delightful Disney film with ███████████████ in fine form as a middle age spinster whose interest turns to witchcraft in World War 11 England.
bhargavvummadi	testing	Sam Jaffe	 Too bad that Tessie O'Shea, Roddy McDowall and █████████ are given so little to do in this endearing film.
bhargavvummadi	testing	Tom Cruise	 Starring two of Hollywood's biggest heavyweights in ██████████ and Brad Pitt, the film's stylish aesthetic and gothic mise en scene captured the audience.
bhargavvummadi	testing	Bill Sykes	 Nancy is still beaten to death, Bullseye narrowly escapes drowning, and ██████████ gets a faithfully graphic come-uppance.
bhargavvummadi	testing	Nancy	 █████ is still beaten to death, Bullseye narrowly escapes drowning, and Bill Sykes gets a faithfully graphic come-uppance.
bhargavvummadi	testing	George Fenton	 █████████████ and Jonas Gwangwa's score certainly had something to do with it.
bhargavvummadi	testing	Paul Winfield	 █████████████ was an underrated actor who pulled off all his roles with such ease, it was hard to tell the man was even acting.
pa1vasanth	training	Jimmy Stewart	 █████████████ is a special favorite of mine.
pa1vasanth	training	Lena	████ is the true pioneer of the modern riot-grrrl movement, confusion, curiosity and wit are her main attributes, she is occasionally angry, but aren't we all?
pa1vasanth	training	Gunga Din	Gawd that made you,<br /><br />You're a better man than I am, ██████████ <br /><br />I still, at 54 years of age, get misty eyed and anyone who says they don't is a liar. 
pa1vasanth	training	Wil Smith	 All the characters were OK and █████████ did another good day at the office.<br /><br />There are no doubt a lot of moral questions to be asked but if you just accept and buy into his agony then it is easier to accept what he has chosen to do
pa1vasanth	training	Amanda Burton	The acting is superb especially █████████████ who's character goes from scary to sweet to disturbing to sad and then some...She does an amazing job balancing Rachels/Carlas feelings and acting out the pain of someone who's lost a child, its so believable that it feels more like a real life story then a drama. 
pa1vasanth	training	Bridget Moynahan 	That is really sad. I hope they will bring it back ... maybe they are waiting until ████████████████ has her baby? Or is it only my wishful thinking? <br /><br />I read some of the comments posted about the show and see so many glowing remarks, similar to mine.
pa1vasanth	training	Porter	Askey does indeed come across as over the top, but it's a great vehicle for him, just as Oh, Mr ██████ is for Will hay.
pa1vasanth	training	Rachel Griffiths	Tulip" is on the "Australian All Shorts" video from "Tribe First Rites" showcasing the talents of first time directors.<br /><br />I wish more scripts had such excellent dialogue.<br /><br />I hope ████████████████ has more stories to tell, she does it so well.
pa1vasanth	training	Patty Duke	For ██████████ to come out in the publics eye and tell her story is an inspiration to those who suffer from this disease.
pa1vasanth	training	Anne Rice	The tale was an eye-opener for me, a New Zealander, with no real conception of the black/white lines, let alone that grey area in the middle where the gens de couleur libre trod gingerly.<br /><br />The characters are very three dimensional, and have been well-rendered in this adaption of the novel, by █████████. 
pa1vasanth	training	Ilka Järvilaturi	This is one of this film's core themes.Darkness in Tallinn appears as an Estonian film but it was made by a Finnish director ████████████████. 
pa1vasanth	training	Wittgenstein	When ████████████ wrote his famous first philosophical piece the tractacus (sp?) he said it was meaningless and useless, but if you read it, after you were done, it would take you to a new level, like a ladder, and then you could throw away the work and see things with clarity and true understanding.
pa1vasanth	training	Adrian Pasdar	█████████████ is excellent is this film. He makes a fascinating woman.
pa1vasanth	training	Ozzy Osbourne	And of course, there's nothing like █████████████ playing a preacher who's asking what happened to the love song :).
pa1vasanth	training	Ulysses	███████ as a film should in no way be compared with the novel, for they are two entirely different entities. However, that being said, the film still manages to maintain many of the elements that made the book work, but since it is a visual medium, it is more difficult to pull of stream-of-consciousness.
pa1vasanth	training	Emma	I especially enjoyed the performance of the ████ character. Well done! The stunts were pretty good for a low budget show. 
pa1vasanth	training	Frank Sinatra's'	Highly recommended for it's feel-good factor alone. OK, so ███████████████ "acting" leaves a lot to be desired but his singing is a great redeeming feature and the songs fit in perfectly with the romantic atmosphere of the film.
pa1vasanth	training	Leon Phelps	This movie was so good. ███████████ is hilarious.
pa1vasanth	training	Claire Danes	Then again, that was when ████████████ was a good actress, not the foolish, arrogant, Hollywood-ized bitch she is today.
pa1vasanth	training	Jimmy Stewart	 █████████████ is a special favorite of mine.
pa1vasanth	training	Maria Flom	 As a result, I can see European, Asian, and American audiences all finding points of similarity between this film and their own lives.<br /><br />If all that wasn't enough, this has the potential to be the best underground date movie of the year...somebody distribute this in the USA, please!<br /><br />Finally: thank you ██████████! It really is a great film.
pa1vasanth	training	Steve Martin	Doing it right makes it seem easy, but doing it wrong ... is there anything worse than a bad comedy? ████████████, pay attention, you are falling in this category again for some reason.<br /><br />Elvira Mistress Of The Dark must have done it right for me to remember this movie fondly
pa1vasanth	training	Michael Cooney	 This movie is goofy as hell! I think it was written as a serious film, but then when it came time to film, ██████████████ said "Hey, let's throw in some humor and spice it up!" The characters are actually slightly developed, too.
pa1vasanth	training	Tamilyn Tomita	This is a great film. From reading other reviews, I can see that I'm not the only one who shed a tear. ██████████████ acted with such skill and conviction, she made the ending heartfelt and memorable. 
pa1vasanth	training	Theodore Rex	I read for pleasure, but when I'm feeling over-stressed or really mind-dead, I watch TV & movies to escape. ████████████ enabled me to do so.
pa1vasanth	training	Chamberlain	Is it because it's from 1975 and has ███████████ and Curtis in it and therefore forgive the by times very bad acting and childish ways of storytelling? <br /><br />Maybe it's because some people get sentimental about this film because they have read the book? (I have not read the book, but I don't think that's a problem, film makers never presume that the viewers have read the book).
pa1vasanth	training	Richard Widmark	It stars ███████████████ as a doctor working at a mental institution whose life becomes in turmoil due to family problems and a rather ludicrous and overworked conflict that really seems like no big deal at all.
pa1vasanth	training	Michael Keaton	It has ██████████████ in it, and he rocks. Unfortunately the film did not deliver.
pa1vasanth	training	spacek  	██████ has been in her share of Leftist movies which brings me to the obvious, inescapable conclusion that the redhead hick is one of those Hollywood liberal morons.
pa1vasanth	training	Danielle Petty	This movie features a gorgeous brunette named ██████████████.
pa1vasanth	training	Jack Nicholson	The alien with the most tolerable voice also happens to be the ██████████████ rip-off alien who always wears his sunglasses.
pa1vasanth	training	Jet Li	In actuality it's barely over 13 minutes of how cool ██████ can do martial arts. and his reflections on the movie.
pa1vasanth	training	Jack Nicholson	The alien with the most tolerable voice also happens to be the ██████████████ rip-off alien who always wears his sunglasses.
pa1vasanth	training	Theodore Rex	Not as soul sucking as ████████████, but it's lightyears away from being a Land Before Time.
pa1vasanth	training	Michael Madsen	Let's just say this is only an indicator of things to come...unfortunately.<br /><br />I'll spare you all the details, but this is sub-par in every manner, even the half-assed acting by ██████████████ is disappointing when you're expecting half-assed acting from him.
pa1vasanth	training	Kate Jackson	What else can I say  ████████████ must have been desperate to direct
pa1vasanth	training	Faye Grant	██████████ so Good in V is wasted with this script from hell. No suprises and no fun.
pa1vasanth	training	Jean Reno	I kept hoping █████████ would say "Excuse me, would you speak up or get the marbles out of your mouth."
pa1vasanth	training	Ozzy Osbourne	How can a movie have █████████████ and still suck? I just don't get it. Trick or Treat managed to do it.
pa1vasanth	training	Peter Falk	his should have been listed as a movie starring ██████████ and not playing the caracter of Colombo because it does not do justice at all to our great lieutenant Colombo.
pa1vasanth	training	Eddie Murphy	████████████ stars in what is written like a sitcom.
pa1vasanth	training	John Hughes	The only joy I got from this is hoping that Sir ███████████ had a good ol' laugh when he saw a screening of this the same year his masterpiece of The Breakfast Club was released.
pa1vasanth	training	Serge Farnel	████████████ made a very precise critics of this film in the revue "The Rwandese night" (www.lanuitrwandaise.net)<br /><br />A critics which shows how France was behind all the situation undergone by the United Nations in Rwanda.
pa1vasanth	training	Dani Behr	he best performances weren't anything to do with acting. In fact probably the most convincing performance came from █████████ of all people, although admittedly does play the stereotypical office secretary.
pa1vasanth	training	Jeffery Dalmers	While the gratuitous cannibalism might make the wannabe ███████████████ hearts race a little faster, it wasn't nearly as interesting as RAVENOUS.
pa1vasanth	training	Arielle Dombasle	<br /><br />Starting at about the halfway point, the beautiful and erotic ████████████████ starts disrobing at every opportunity.
pa1vasanth	training	Ziva Rodann	he cast helps very little. With only one exception (███████████ is the lone bright spot 
pa1vasanth	training	Macist	Everything is bad in this film. The story (is there a story?) is going nowhere, completely incoherent, the acting (some dialogs are simply just ridiculous), the music score (what the **** is that?), the editing, and especially the artistic direction, a pure disaster. Reminds me the old ██████ movies... To give you an example of the amateurism of the production, the mermaid's costume is a sleeping bag with spangles sticked on it.
pa1vasanth	training	George Goble	I could not find ████████████ listed in the credits but I remember him in the movie. The sining was terrible and the songs even worse.
pa1vasanth	training	Dianne Keaton	As I sat subjected to this televised mediocrity, I wondered why? Why did █████████████ agree to this trash? The movie uses meaningless, contrived plot lines to deliver trash to homes of thousands.
pa1vasanth	validation	Johnson	███████, as Annie is at times annoying and over acted..you cannot convince yourself that she truly is Annie. 
pa1vasanth	validation	Lilith	Can't say the same for her co star ██████ with her whining voice that grates on your nervous system. Appeared disinterested & gave the impression that just her presence on the set was all that was needed.
pa1vasanth	validation	Maddy	We not only discovered one of the worst movies out there, but also that it is a cult classic! It is filled w/plot holes and makes no sense. The actress who plays █████ is pretty, but that's about it.
pa1vasanth	validation	JESSICA	███████: A GHOST STORY is as the name implies a ghost story. The theme is meant to be horror but comes across closer to comedy!<br /><br />A woman comes who was brutally murdered comes back from the dead.
pa1vasanth	validation	John Saxon	It seems like this is the only film that ██████████ ever directed, and that he had the good sense to stop after that and stay in front of the camera.
pa1vasanth	validation	Eagles Donovan McNabb	Also, one of the grandsons friends was wearing an █████████████████████ jersey.
pa1vasanth	validation	Meryl Streep	I saw this movie at a 'sneak preview' and i must honestly confess that I do not like films with ████████████ that much.
pa1vasanth	validation	J. Varhola	<br /><br />Michael ██████████, Skirmisher Online Gaming Magazine This movie is told through the eyes of a young teacher at a catholic school, watching as the RAWANDAN genocide un-furls around him.
pa1vasanth	validation	MAGNOLIA	I mean, let's face it, the acting is horrible (I mean: soap opera-level), the story has not one surprise (this has been done endless times before, connecting several storylines: SHORT CUTS, ████████, PLAYING BY HEART, only much better), not one realistic character in it (some true freak-seeing along the way, notice the hilarious zombie-like daughter), and so on and so on.<br /><br />As if that's not enough, the film is 135 min.
pa1vasanth	validation	George W. Bush	Lion's Gate completely deceives on this bombshell... No...this is a disaster. After watching this film, you would swear ██████████████ had his hands all over the making of this film... yes its that idiotic.<br /><br />Stay away, unless of course you just want to watch the worst movie of all time.
pa1vasanth	validation	Andy Fastow	The film did a very poor job of explaining what "business" Enron was in that might actually have been on the up-and-up before it started hiding its debts in the entities created by ███████████
pa1vasanth	validation	Dana Andrews	"Crack" was a truly excellent movie starring ████████████. His team of scientists, working in South Africa, drilled down to the crust and "punched through" with a nuclear device in order to provide a steady source of geothermic energy
pa1vasanth	validation	David Bowie	Almost Pythonesque.<br /><br />The show did have a cool opening title sequence set to the ███████████ song of the same name This film, which I rented under the title "Black Voodoo" should be avoided.
pa1vasanth	validation	Dansen	I'm sure i was counting in the hundreds before I gave up and started watching the film again.<br /><br />Secondly, what the hell is with those blue monkey things? OK, so the ██████ family led very private lives and had one brown eye one blue eye, but since when does that transform people into subterranean carnivorous blue zombie-creatures?<br /><br />and finally, 
pa1vasanth	validation	Seagal	██████ was way off the mark with this film.
pa1vasanth	validation	Tom Arnold	 You almost feel sorry for ██████████, but then you don't because you remember he was actually IN the movie.
pa1vasanth	validation	Ironheart	Me and a couple of friends went to rent some movies one day, we picked one each and one of us picked █████████
pa1vasanth	validation	Nigel Hawthorne	But ultimately I wondered two things.... How could so much talent lead to such a bizarre mess? What is that accent that ███████████████ is putting on? He is/was a great actor and so what is that accent all about? It is impossible to identify? What was he trying to do? Maybe it is his subtle indication as if to say to us: 'I've got involved with a turkey so here's a crap accent to go with it!'
pa1vasanth	validation	Michelle Johnson	Not the funniest movie ever.....but I have to watch this film at least once a year just so I can fall in Love with ████████████████ all over again.
pa1vasanth	validation	John Candy	ARMED AND DANGEROUS is not one of the greats of ██████████.
pa1vasanth	validation	Anita Briem	<br /><br />But all is not bad. The movie has a big budget appearance, mainly due to the excellent cinematography (the scenes from past times really shines here), tight editing and an atmospheric soundtrack. Even though most of the actors are pretty bad, ███████████ is an exception, making the most of what she has to work with
pa1vasanth	validation	Vampire Assassin	You will also be able to enjoy the one and only face of the ████████████████ as he never changes his expression despite his obvious attempts to.
pa1vasanth	validation	Helen Mirren	It is basically a bland teen comedy that I only watched because I like ████████████, who is in fact very good as an impossibly cruel teacher.
pa1vasanth	validation	Johnson	"<br /><br />With only the exceptions mentioned, these people are the kind hardly deserving or worthy of several hundred thousands of dollars being thrown away in presenting their stories.<br /><br />PS--Writer/director, ███████, definitely appears to have a problem with showing gay sexual scenes----with no such problems in presenting more prolonged and revealing heterosexual ones.
pa1vasanth	validation	anthony sabato jr	this could have been good,but sadly,its too inplausible,█████████████████ has a grudge...PLEASE!I wanted to like it,love shark movies ,someone should have asked my opinion before they wrote this.
pa1vasanth	validation	Hanks	 █████ was overdone and i don't see why there couldn't have been other actors' voices be used.
pa1vasanth	validation	Noble Willingham	Zero characters beyond ████████████████ are developed. The never ending closeups of lips and telephones are sleep inducing, and the script is so underdeveloped that a chimpanzee could have written it. 
pa1vasanth	validation	Pam Grier	█████████ tries, but when you have nothing to work with, even her considerable talent cannot prevent a disaster.
pa1vasanth	validation	Robin Williams	██████████████ is excellent in this movie and it is a pity the material is not enough of a match for him.
pa1vasanth	validation	Jason	Skip this film and re-watch another Freddy or █████ flick and you'll be way more content.
pa1vasanth	testing	Dudelson  	It has nothing to do with those movies, except it does show that producers/directors ████████ and Clavell are in a rut.
pa1vasanth	testing	Catherine  	I rented the DVD and had to force myself to watch it until the end.<br /><br />My advice: read the book, it is much better and you won't have to put up with all these silly images and ridiculous dreams █████████ has.<br /><br />I think I have never watched such a bad movie.
pa1vasanth	testing	Daniel  	I have to wonder if they were actually being paid, or whether it was some form of community service or plea bargain.<br /><br />"Please, keep watching," whines ██████; honestly, I wouldn't bother.
pa1vasanth	testing	Patrick  	The worst movie I have ever seen. The sound quality was bad, the cutting of the scenes was even worse and above all it was not logic and it had no speed...<br /><br />I first tought: "Oh No, I don't want the trail that proves that poor ███████ was an innocent killer". 
pa1vasanth	testing	Hannah	The only original bit was the Brighton location for gangsters. It is certainly no "Lock Stock etc......." ██████ was likeable in "Sliding Doors".
pa1vasanth	testing	Baywatch   	The characters lack depth and they seem to be incredibly selfish nd generally un-likable people. <br /><br />To quote a friend "Las Vegas is like Baywaych in a Casino" In my opinion thats way to generous, ████████ was way better, and much more realistic.
pa1vasanth	testing	Nick  	Oh wow, the character shares my name first name! ████! This movie as bad as the first one, if not worse. Well, at least there's an actual octopus in this movie.
pa1vasanth	testing	Ryan 	 Even if ████ wasn't such of an annoying person, this would still be bad, i said even if, where do we begin? "directors log" You will have the urge to snatch his tape recorder and pound it with a hammer or punt it into a lake, a haunted lake of course.
pa1vasanth	testing	Disney 	 It would have been far better if they had done what ██████ did with Education For Death and been totally serious.
pa1vasanth	testing	Hitchcock  	It works best as a Gallic ode to █████████'s Rear Window, because the notion of voyeurism is the constant theme that fires the intricate screenplay. 
jdewberry	training	Anderson	The cast deserve props for acting with admirable sincerity: ████████, Cage and Reinhold all do respectable work with their parts, with fine support from Joe Pantoliano as Zandalee's merry flamboyant homosexual friend Gerri, Viveca Lindfors as Theirry's wise, perceptive mother Tatta, Aaron Neville as friendly bartender Jack, and Steve Buscemi as a funny, blithely shameless thief.

jdewberry	training	Yuen Woo Ping	The fight scenes were choreographed by action scene psychopath █████████████, who also did the fights in The Matrix.

jdewberry	training	Sean Connery	However ████████████ is of course a great actor and that is the only reason why he is still able to carry the movie as good as he does.
jdewberry	training	David Deal	Those interested should get the book on the subject by ██████████ - Television Fright Films of the 70's.

jdewberry	training	Jackson Rippner	We are far more likely to encounter the benign evil of ███████████████ than Freddy Kruger, and Cillian Murphy (Batman Begins) does an excellent job of presenting a sociable, friendly, even charismatic killer.

jdewberry	training	Damon	█████ plays his signature role with reserve but competency (which sounds minor but that it genuinely looks like Matt Damon could evade the CIA and Interpol is something), but noticeable moments of poignancy as he still struggles to find his humanity.
jdewberry	training	Julia Stiles	The music also helped generate much suspense, and there was hardly ever a moment to not nail-bite over. The acting is good, and the evolution of ████████████' character "Nicky" put her situation into a new highly sympathetic light.

jdewberry	testing	Mervyn Leroy	But the film, directed by legendary director ████████████, was constantly vetted and script approval as well as every aspect of the film, down to clothing, was closely watched and controlled by J. Edgar Hoover.
jdewberry	testing Henry Thomas	████████████ gives a good performance as Raymond Toker, a young loner who finds a baby abandoned in the woods.
jdewberry	testing Jean Simmons	Police believe ████████████ is guilty of a crime, when she plainly isn't.
jdewberry	testing	Capone	In his day, ██████ may have had bootlegging as a means through which to line his coffers with illicit gain, but Lopez has the modern day equivalent, and it's even more lucrative: Cocaine.
jdewberry	testing Julia Stiles	At his bachelor party, Paul gets a little too drunk and somehow ends up taking a pretty dancer named Becky (████████████) back to his digs.
jdewberry	testing	Edward Woodward	███████████████ is the best Ghost of Christmas Present I've ever seen.
jdewberry	testing	Michael Meyers	John Carpenter uses ██████████████ as a metaphor against the implied safety of middle class suburbia.
sanojdoddapaneni	testing	Kevin Bacon	I tried to love this movie I really did ███████████ plays a cerebral palsy victim who is befriended by a 10-year-old girl whose fantasies of digging to China, flying away in a balloon, and so on, are her way of coping with a dreary existence I admit I did fast-forward through one of the scenes in which the two of them share friendship and simple pleasures while soulful piano music plays in the background Okay, three or four of those type scenes Maybe nine or ten Okay, okay, it was fourteen But I did sit and watch most of them.
sanojdoddapaneni	testing	Hackman	But to be a little more precise I do not think that it is as bad as it actually could be Eventhough the actors (famous to semi-famous) didn't do a very great job Directors fault? Could be the script as well hard for me to say? Anyway, if you are after a lot of cool guns and action this is not the movie for you but they do run around with a lot of ww2 vintage guns Sort of fun :) Well I guess I could say more but it just doesn't feel as if it's worth it If you are desperate enough or a ███████ freak see it otherwise don't! Live well and prosper
sanojdoddapaneni	testing	Phillip Seymour Hoffman	 This movie really has nothing going for it With the Reverend played by ███████████████████████ complaining about his constipation and other toilet humor in a 2.5 hour movie, you know that they made no cuts at all and left the crap in, literally It's a waste of good talent, and a total embarrassment Dreadful! 
sanojdoddapaneni	testing	Dr Klaus	A friend of mine loves tacky horror films so I often get to see low budget stuff like this This is, however the first time I have been compelled to write a review of one... Put simply this is probably the worst film I have ever seen! Even worse then Boggy Creek II! The entire budget for the film seems to have been spent on a brief scene in the middle when ████████ stands in this chamber thing & turns all vampire-ish. The only good thing to say about it is that it was hilarious after a few beers (but for all the wrong reasons).
sanojdoddapaneni	testing	Barney	This may just be the worst movie of all time Never have I seen such horrible film making before in my life Its so bad I think I want to go watch ██████ instead I advise everyone who reads this to write a petition to get this movie off of our film history so we can never hear from it again I give it 1 out of 10.
sanojdoddapaneni	testing	Mark	This documentary is such a wonderful example of what an entertaining and amazing experience a documentary can be, if done so well as this The subject, ████, is smart, funny and very driven, and this story of his personal fight to live his dreams will be inspiring to anyone who knows what it is like to harbor an impossible dream See this mov
sanojdoddapaneni	testing	Tripper	Seeing this movie always reminds me of what I remember summer being like, God! such a long time ago The entire scene involving the overnight, from the canoe procession to the end of the trip, is precious, and ███████'s story about the homicidal maniac is urban legend right out of my youth A highly entertaining movie, made many times better by the awful sequels that followed.
sanojdoddapaneni	testing	Jon Bon Jovi	This delightful movie tells the story of buds And it's incredible You'll laugh, and you'll smile, and you'll laugh It's really all about the laughs When ████████████ is funny in a movie, it's a heck of a movie! 'nuff said Now go watch it!
sanojdoddapaneni	testing	Meryl Streep	A great story, although one we are certainly familiar with ████████████ proves that she is truly the best actress in film today Very entertaining, and just what I expected Don't go see this film unless you are prepared to be used and manipulated emotionally, but if you have that expectation, then you will enjoy the ride.....
sanojdoddapaneni	testing	Natalie Portman	Its the best movie I have seen in 2000, it has the beautiful and talented ███████████████ in it It has a great storyline, cast and soundtrack I enjoyed it very much 10 out of 10
sanojdoddapaneni	validation	John Kielty's	Seriously engaging, intelligent and thought provoking drama at its very best Mean, gripping, moody and captivating Every home should have a copy! Don't take my word for it see it yourself One Life Stand makes you consider your own lifestyle and how you treat your family and friends Beautiful photography and impressive acting makes for one of the best cinema-graphic experiences of the year █████████████ debut is a delight and adds a real touch of truth and realism to this deep and gritty film This is a film that cares and has an honesty that is unequalled in recent years No car chases, but a film packed with hum our and emotion I first saw this film screened at the Edinburgh film festival in 2000 and am now delighted to be able to own a copy on DVD.
sanojdoddapaneni	validation	Chipmunks	There's also a very sweet song in which the █████████ sing about traveling the world and we get to see them at major landmarks throughout the globe One thing about the Chipmunk characters is that, despite the potentially annoying vocals, the songwriters always managed to write songs that were catchy without ever being grating.
sanojdoddapaneni	validation	Paul Henreid	████████████ plays a tough guy in here.
sanojdoddapaneni	validation	SHIRLEY VALENTINE	UNCONDITIONAL LOVE is surprisingly entertaining While the plot goes off in perhaps too many directions, making for an overlong movie, it never fails to charm and ingratiate itself The several plotlines, one warmly reminiscent of █████████████████, provide ample smiles, laughs, wisdom and tenderness It all shouldn't work, and at times it certainly bumps along, but forgive its inconsistencies, sit back and have a good time It's a charmer!
sanojdoddapaneni	validation	Zoey	████ and her stupid friends are weak characters and the pot sucks and is really lame  The lame continuuity and pot sucks.
sanojdoddapaneni	validation	Henry Brandon	Another must have film █████████████ is a favorite! I was so surprised when I learned years ago that he was from Germany because he sounds & looks so typically American! And wasn't he great in The Searchers as Chief Scar??!! Another of my favorites, I have it & watch it over & again Now if I could add this one to my collection, it would make my day! This is a great wildlife story & film for all ages The scenery is so absolutely beautiful & the plight of the endangered snow leopards is told with such great emotion it will spark the interest in endangered species in anyone, especially children If I could I would give a copy to all of my grands & great grands!
sanojdoddapaneni	validation	Clifton Webb	████████████ as Mr Scoutmaster is one of the all-time greats for comedy and remembering an innocence, now diminished in the world I cannot understand why the networks like American Movie Classics and such do not show this movie, although I have requested it time and again. This movie should be shown to children now for its portrayal of loyalty, respect, dedication and resolve to achieve the best possible on an individual basis There is so much low self-esteem talked about in present daily lives, but this movie, among many, many others, would be a wonderful learning tool for the present-day younger generation to see what can be accomplished by common sense and decency and pride in yourself and your achievements to better yourself Sad that this type of movie does not appeal to modern audiences It certainly appealed to us 'baby boomer' generation of yesterday OLD LESSONS ARE UNIVERSAL AND TIMELESS.
sanojdoddapaneni	validation	Faulkner	While you may disagree with the politics, the artistry of the analogy, coupled with the more overt politics of the film, are wonderful. Had only ████████ (I am from Alabama) had the power of film beyond the Hollywood market, what interesting tales would have been told.
sanojdoddapaneni	validation	Rosie Perez	This was a great movie Something not only for Black History month but as a reminder of the goodness of people and the statement that it truly does take a village to raise a child The performances by S Eptath was outstanding Mos Def and his singing was off the hook Had to do a double take when I saw that was ███████████ there But the supporting cast of actors and actresses made this worth watching All the different stories they had was amazing And how Nanny protected Jr and literally everyone else that was in her presence I can truly understand her being the matriarch of that time period and even more so how tired she was in helping everyone Cant wait for it to come out on DVD It would be a welcome addition to any movie library.
sanojdoddapaneni	validation	Stanley Kubrick	If this film had been directed by DW Griffith or ███████████████, it would be recognized for what it is: a cinematic masterpiece, told with depth and subtlety and passion, a film with no equal in the visual realm It is unremittingly stunning and also very brutal in its depiction of our great heritage of greed and annihilation And of course, what the reviewers could not abide is it doesn't tell a simple narrative dick-and-jane tale like 99% of hollywood output Its characters are complex and confused by their passions and thoughts, fears and emotions They even appear to be thinking, something your average movie reviewers do not understand and cannot abide, so they destroyed it See the original uncut wide-screen version It is stunning.
sanojdoddapaneni	validation	Angelina	This was a pretty good movie that was overall done quite well The idea about Mercy (won't spoil) was original also I think ████████ did a good job as one of her first movies The only things I frowned upon were some of the corny fight scenes (won't spoil either) I liked the first movie and I liked this one as well 7/10
sanojdoddapaneni	validation	Edward Furlong	I prefer some in a horror flick if it can't come up with an original plot/premise And that tired as all hell reality TV show gone wrong thing? It's been done before and a lot better Like Wrong Turn 2 or...ummm....whatever that movie was called with ██████████████.
sanojdoddapaneni	validation	Jim Beam	One of the longest 80 minutes of my life I trooped it out though with the help of my old friend ████████.
sanojdoddapaneni	validation	Hanks	The good thing is that this movie will take a bath in the box office and maybe producers will learn to keep from tampering with a story that needs no improvement █████ was overdone and i don't see why there couldn't have been other actors' voices be used.
sanojdoddapaneni	validation	Demi Moore	Apart from that, it is very entertaining and, yes, ██████████ is absolutely splendid.
sanojdoddapaneni	validation	Siegel	There are films that are not released in theaters but on video This one should be allowed to age and disintegrate the way old nitrate film stock does No story, inept violence, over acted, badly written and the sorry thing is that the star was not the only bad part in the film And I did like and enjoyed some of ██████'s other movies.
sanojdoddapaneni	validation	Paul Newmans	A shame, because some scenes really shine Two or three, that is. 4 out of 10 grubby ████████████.
sanojdoddapaneni	validation	Mr Ripper	This film could have included longer, better interviews with the people themselves, letting them tell their stories Instead █████████ indulgently draws the story towards himself making it some kind of personal journey, and unfortunately it doesn't end up being much of one I never really got a sense of any growth as he explores the subject, and he never indicates what about the subject pulled him in in the first place He just drags us from one place to the next, brushes lightly on the situation and characters, hangs around showing too much uneventful slow-motion footage of people just walking around the streets, then moves on to his next destination.
sanojdoddapaneni	validation	Gary Busey's	A story that could have been interesting is completely wasted by incredibly bad acting and horrible editing/directing Maybe it could become a classic because of all the weird over-acting (████████████ character for example)
sanojdoddapaneni	validation	Mark Griffiths	ell, this movie shows us that ██████████████ and producers think we all are idiots.
sanojdoddapaneni	validation	Bruce Dern's	████████████ one minute part is orders of magnitude better than anything else in this flick.
sanojdoddapaneni	validation	Siegel	There are films that are not released in theaters but on video This one should be allowed to age and disintegrate the way old nitrate film stock does No story, inept violence, over acted, badly written and the sorry thing is that the star was not the only bad part in the film And I did like and enjoyed some of ██████'s other movies.
sanojdoddapaneni	validation	Lena Endre	The story line was very straight forward and easy to follow and contained a lot of no-brainer comedy to a point where it just got boring Some of the audience seemed to find it funny but I like more intelligent humor. There were several known Swedish actors in the movie and their performance were decent considering the script ██████████ was good looking as always. I don't remember the original movie so I can't say if it's better or worse. If you enjoy movies like Sällskapsresan this movie might be worth taking a look at.
sanojdoddapaneni	validation	Sandra	I saw this by chance showing on cable on wanted to like it as I thought ██████ was quite funny from what I remembered The only facial movement I had throughout the movie was jaw dropping stunned at how awful a movie I just suffered through. The person who said this is one of the funniest movies of all time please point out one line, just one scene, that is even worth a chuckle. She is a much better singer than I remember her to be, but I didn't want to watch a lounge act. I think this is a movie try hard to like since they think they should and don't view it objectively.
sanojdoddapaneni	validation	Giovanni Bocaccio's	Though the title may suggest examples of the 10 commandments, it is a definitely incorrect assumption This is an adaptation of 9 SEEMINGLY unrelated stories from ███████████████████ 14th century Decameron story collection. Set within a medieval Italian town's largely peasant population, it is a diatribe on the reality of sex (and its consequences) within that world and time A realistic view of Life within this world, it sometimes feels like a journey back in time. Given the depicted human element of its time, one can also see the more adventurous side of morality in its protagonists - as well as the ironies of Life, at times Or it may also be viewed as a general satire of the Catholic Church's rules. Nothing terribly special, but definitely interesting if one comes with no expectations or assumptions.
sanojdoddapaneni	validation	Quenton Tarantino	What an appalling piece of rubbish!!! Who ARE all these people who blubber on about how good this is? Yes, it's arty; and yes, it's foreign, but ... that's not enough The plot is boring and disjointed, like a reality show but not so slickly made. The people are intrinsically uninteresting; but as characters they don't have enough depth to feel empathy for them If they are based on real people then I feel very, very sorry for them. The violence (and some of it is very violent) seems quite ostentatious and gratuitous It's like the producer has visions of being █████████████████ Not that I think very much of him, either. And oh yes: if I had neighbours like these, I'd move!
sanojdoddapaneni	validation	Darth Vadar	Looks like, all we see is a bright light signaling his approach and all we hear is a cheap interpretation of ███████████ voices and a soundtrack stolen from various horror movies.
sanojdoddapaneni	validation	Ross Partridge	A homeless man hands it over to artist hairdo ██████████████, who then has strange visions and discovers some unpleasant revelations about his past.
sanojdoddapaneni	validation	Tom Cruise	Great cast Great acting Unpredictable story line for the first half hour or so I was really wanting to know what was going to happen to each of these unredeeming characters, and how their seemingly disparate lives would become intertwined But when the writers took out the glue to start connecting the players, they mistakenly used super glue and brought the movie to a standstill for the last two hours I kept thinking it would get better, but it only got worse Don't believe the reviews This is a waste of time  Think about it -- ██████████ made ugly -- why? The gorgeous hunky bartender wearing braces -- why? I know it had to do with the plot, but without them, at least there would have been one attractive cast member to remember.
sanojdoddapaneni	validation	Buzz Aldrin	1st the good news The 3-D is spectacularly well done, and they don't go for the gotcha gimmicks The film is based on the true story of the high point in human history, and even features one of the actual participants in that story: ███████████. And now the meat of the matter: It's about FLIES, for krissakes! Flies with big, googy human eyes, true, but flies nonetheless Remember when I likened the Underworld movies to rats vs cockroaches? That wasn't intended as praise, and I never dreamed anyone would take it literally This one's got even less empathy going for it Baby maggots? Ugh In one of those odd confluences of Hollywood groupthink, this flik was evidently on the drawing boards at the same time as Space Chimps, also about critters in space. Go rent Apollo 13 and see a 9-rated movie about the REAL space program (RIP).
sanojdoddapaneni	training	Wanda	Was that █████ the Evil Lesbian (as billed in the credits)?
sanojdoddapaneni	training	Michael Dorn	Don't be fooled by the IMDB credits. This is not a ████████████ movie.
sanojdoddapaneni	training	Gail O'Grady	This movie is an embarrassment to film-making I can't believe it was even listed as a comedy - not funny Not only was the script atrocious, but the casting people should be shot ████████████ is just a great actress, but beyond that.. %99 of the rest of the cast...ouch Pretty much everyone else...wow it is hard to even...wow Here is the number one rule about comedy DON'T TRY TO BE FUNNY There are a lot of very talented actors in Canada who can do drama and comedy - none of them were used in this film Canadian nepotism and casting directors are helping to perpetuate bad film-making in Canada I realize this is technically a US film, but look at the director, actors, location, etc I just saw this on Bravo - they should be ashamed that they bought the rights to show this film Again, there are a lot of great films out there that can't get airtime and they show this crap.
sanojdoddapaneni	training	Emile Zola	This movie reminds me of Irréversible (2002), another art-work movie with is a violent and radical approach of human nature I did not like the movie but I cannot say that it is a bad movie, it is just special I reminds me also of Camping Cosmos (1996) where a bunch of low-class figures are residents of a camp at the sea in Belgium The same description of people living together, side by side against their wills and with all the confrontation of characters that do not match together I also thought about the books by the French writer ██████████ who was a writer of the style that is naturalism I did not like the movie and I also do not like the people who are in it They all seem so vulgar, without any basic good taste One could ask the question why do they live, they all seem to be on this planet a a member of a big farce, forced to live against their will Or you could say: the hell is on this world.
sanojdoddapaneni	training	Christopher Lee	I actually have a fondness for ███████████████, but this just wasn't up to his other performances.. and he was one of the better actors. The film does not live up to its premise It's not that scary, it's overly melodramatic, and it draaaaaags Every time I thought, Oh, HERE comes the good part the good part never quite arrived. The Evil Ones aren't at all convincing Most of the other characters were also lacking in depth. Perhaps if I'd been in the proper frame of mind, I might have enjoyed some MSTie-fication at this film's expense, but... Naaahhh.. Didn't really seem to be worth the effort It wasn't really very good, it wasn't really very bad, it was just mediocre.
sanojdoddapaneni	training	Uma Thurman	This is a candidate for the single most disappointing movie experience of my lifetime Cool title, excellent director (I saw To Die For and Drugstore Cowboy before this), and hey - ███████████ in the cast How can you go wrong? Well, that is a question that throbbed in my temples for hours after I watched this turkey. Disjointed and unfunny in an attempt to be offbeat, this is a dead-zone of a movie that should be avoided at all costs Its critical lambasting was well deserved You have here one of those rare films that does not contain a single redeeming quality Zero out of ****.
sanojdoddapaneni	training	Pamela Springsteen	The acting in this movie made the cast of the original Friday the 13th look like thespians doing a rendition of Macbeth Campy requires bad acting, but come on ██████████████████ as the evil out-of-touch-with-reality killer did a better job of killing off my interest than she did killing off the entire cast.
sanojdoddapaneni	training	Ben Affleck	I went to see this film at the cinemas and i was shocked when I got in the room There was only me and my girlfriend! This shouted to me that this film is not very good  Not to my surprise, the film was dire ███████████ plays a guy who buys a family for Christmas It is a very predictable narrative with him falling in love with the girl that hates him His acting is OKish but for the comedy aspect of the film he is not very good The plot line is poor and the comedy almost non-existent. However, there are some good points For example, the family is falling apart and the mother is very funny. I hope this review stops other people wasting their money I was very embarrassed when I came out of the room!!!
sanojdoddapaneni	training	Mckenna	I read all these reviews on here about how this is a such a good movie Jeez, this movie was predictable and pretty boring The acting was below average most of the time, especially by ███████ I haven't seen a more pathetic attempt at making someone badass in a movie Oh man, this movie was a letdown I also read somewhere this might be a cult classic I know there are followers of the director, but this movie was just a average piece of film. The script was lame, for the most part the acting was lame, this movie was lame. Oh and pray for the guy that used to be in Cheers He looks really bad  The best actor in this movie was probably the guy in Office Space, and he was only in this movie for about 8 minutes. 4/10
sanojdoddapaneni	training	David Self	They screwed up this story! In the end Nell is all heroic and taking on for the team to save all their asses from Hill House and a bunch of nonsense like that! They added heads getting chopped, wires cutting peoples faces, and the ceiling turning into a giant hand! What the hell is that about??? I own and love the original movie, I read the book and I love it! The reason why the original movie and the book are so great is because it scares you so much without even showing the ghost There is no gore There is no ceiling hand It is only the ghost ad how ghosts can truly kill a person They cannot kill us, they cannot throw us about the room or fly a knife into our head No They can only drive us mad Taking away all our senses of security Nell was a selfish woman She only wanted good things for herself Yes, she cared a little for the others, but not too much ██████████ and Jan de Bont have taken a crap on this great story! I hate this damn remake!
sanojdoddapaneni	training	Sicheritz	I hope no one outside will ever have to see this one Perhaps if you are familiar with the original sitcom it could be interesting to watch what director █████████ made of his series I think he missed his chance and wasted time and money.
sanojdoddapaneni	training	Zhang Ziyi	Charlotte's deadly beauty and lethal kicks make the movie cooler than it'd be otherwise.The story is so poor and Charlotte's character dies in such a foolish way, that you wonder if this's the ending they had thought of for this movie I wish somebody could tell that an alternative ending exists, but I fear it doesn't As for the rest of the cst, well I'd say they simply didn't act very well; although the blame should be put on the poor script.This movie reminds me of Rush Hour 2 where ██████████ dies in absurd way, since she had been the only one who had stolen the show during the whole movie I could give this movie 2/5
sanojdoddapaneni	training	patrick rea	five minutes after watching this i logged on to IMDb to warn all of you out there not to bother with this movie.. genre:horror? it had moments of mild suspense and throughout the whole movie i was thinking to myself somethings gotta happen soon it did not...when the movie ended i felt so embarrassed for the writer/director i've never been the biggest fan of ███████████ this guy just does not know how to make movies and after watching this sorry excuse of a horror flick i've gone from not been the biggest fan to will not watch another of his works.. i was taken in by the plot summary please don't make the same mistake. i gave this movie a 2 for the actors..they were not bad and it wasn't there fault they got such bad direction...
sanojdoddapaneni	training	Robin Williams	This movie is a mess I'm surprised it even has a theatrical release WIthout ██████████████ it would have gone straight to video It is poorly written It is poorly directed It's worse offense is that it has taken an interesting topic and reduced it to a ridiculous and BORING thriller that has no thrills and no suspense and no inner or emotional logic.Especially after the first half hour the movie dovetails into a series of ridiculous set pieces that are so over the top that the audience I saw it with was laughing at it Save your money The trailer is totally misleading - it is not suspenseful and there are no thrills - in fact the movie's truly worst offense is that it is simply boring.
sanojdoddapaneni	training	Luke Perry	Except this time there is ██████████ too This films version of the familiar save-the-world plot involves super-earthquakes beginning in the Pacific Northwest.
sanojdoddapaneni	training	Amy Irving	██████████ was put in this film to try and get a part of the Halloween H20 audience.
sanojdoddapaneni	training	Nicholas Cage	Even more so in that the carefully crafted (or however they put it) conclusion didn't seem to follow logically from the plot (which naturally I can't elaborate on without introducing spoilers), and instead negates what merit the plot had up to that point. It is a film that might logically appeal to psychopaths, pedophiles, and possibly die-hard █████████████ fans, but only to a few of the mainstream audience If you really want something along these lines, I heartily recommend M Night Shyamalan’s.
sanojdoddapaneni	training	Mary Tyler Moore	This film is not devoid of charm and also shows a bit of warmth, but ultimately this effort is too vain and too strongly focussed on the leads There is no doubt that ████████████████ knows what to do with all her screen time but she takes too much of the limelight away from the rest of the cast. Another problem is the overburdening of the script with cliches The daughter who secretly drops out of college, an older woman finding it difficult to get a good job (and first ends up with fairly demeaning work), the sleazy network executive with his executive toys who goes for glitz over substance, the journalist who sticks up for her beliefs, etc There is nothing really wrong with any of these, i.e they are all firmly rooted in reality, but in combination they are just too much and leave us with too much deja-vu and too few surprises.
sanojdoddapaneni	training	Charles Wellington	OK, so no one would expect Lance to grab a body like that and suddenly start acting like ██████████████████.
sanojdoddapaneni	training	Joel Hodgson's	I saw this one on the late, late, late, late show back when MST3K was just a twinkle in ██████████████ eye.
sanojdoddapaneni	training	Billy	I was bored, around 10pm, so I watched this movie And I could not stop laughing Everything was so ridiculous The way the kids were acting like they were older than 11 just cracked me up One of the kids had a ring, that supposedly killed people after 3 or so years It gave me the impression that he wanted to be a gangster. It's pretty hard to take little kids seriously, especially when it has to do with eating worms They act like everything is such a big deal, like if █████ (the main character) doesn't eat the worms then the world will end. This is a good movie for little kids (excluding the fact that a 5 year old says 'penis'), but not for teens or adults who don't want to waste their time.
sanojdoddapaneni	training	Tom Savini	Now I don't hate cheap movies I just don't see why you should waste any money for a movie you could shoot with your dad's camcorder If I rent a movie, I want it to be a MOVIE, not a bunch of people thinking it would be a good idea to waste some MiniDV - Tapes. Maybe I hate this one so much because the guy in the video store said it was great, and it wasn't Maybe I hate it because it's cheap, has the dumbest plot EVER, the most unrealistic characters EVER and the really, really, really WORST SHOWDOWN in the history of films EVER Even ██████████ can't save this. Seriously, this one is a complete waste of time.

sanojdoddapaneni	training	Rick Mercer's	Little Mosque is one of the most boring CBC comedies I have ever seen They have a way of producing the easiest comedy programming they can for the oldest most-easily-offended viewers which for CBC means 85 year old farmers in Saskatchewan The jokes are all predictable and so deathly lame I can't believe it The performances are very hammy and over acted but I don't blame the actors since those kind of one dimensional stereotyped characters are probably exactly what the CBC asked for and demanded Very lame show with bad jokes they tried to present as controversial well it is less controversial than the other boring CBC comedies like The Hour Has 22 Minutes, Royal Canadian Air Farce and █████████████ Report.

sanojdoddapaneni	training	Jesse Franco	I know ████████████ is responsible for a wide variety of films, and I mainly go for his horror films, as lousy as they are at times I guess it was morbid curiousity that drew me to this, and I wasn't even curious enough to finish it.
sanojdoddapaneni	training	John Williams	The cast is good, while not excellent As another commenter pointed out the █████████████ sound score was, as usual, excellent.
sanojdoddapaneni	training	Scarface Anyways	This movie can be described in those 2 words just unbelievable This is the best movie ever made, I just cant see why this movie isnt in the top 250 I also can't see why anybody would not love ████████████████, if you havnt seen it, it is a must buy.
sanojdoddapaneni	training	Meryl	Besides █████'s performance which has gained a lot of recognition and praise, the movie's greatest asset is the story it is based on.
sanojdoddapaneni	training	Mia	It is an extremely well composed movie, with a story which has a perfect balance of humor and seriousness, which is rarely seen You get happy, you get hurt, and basically everything in between Finally you can't help falling in love with ███(if you are a boy I guess(the main actress)) She is an extremely well chosen actress, as a lot of the other actors/actresses. Enjoy

This movie is essentially about a man good as pissing people off However, he has an innate set of ethics that prevents him from doing things that might just make him famous But in the end he ends up doing them, the culture of life. The movie is well toned with humor, romance, good acting and also a bit of a lap dance Its one of those movies where you could just be happy when it ends.
sanojdoddapaneni	training	Conan	A great alternative to another short story about █████ the Barbarian, but not to a novel.
sanojdoddapaneni	training	Jennie Livingston	In the beginning of this film, one of the commentators says that he was told that he has two strikes against him: he is black and male But in addition to that, he has a third strike: he's gay You're going to have to be stronger than you ever imagined, he is told Paris is Burning is a documentary about gay black and Hispanic men who are tranvestites or transsexuals. The miracle of Paris is Burning is that director █████████████████ takes a subject that could have very easily become a freak show and allows the people in it their humanity We learn their views of homosexuality, men, women, their hopes, their disappointments, their dreams.
sanojdoddapaneni	training	Paul Muni	Saying a film is depressing isn't necessarily a bad thing I'm very willing to watch a depressing film if there is a point to be made and this one certainly has one It's the often heartbreaking story of a Chinese man and his family as they experience many years of both hardship and plenty BUT, I must warn you that this might just be about the most depressing film to come out of Hollywood in the 1930s--because peasant life in China was TOUGH to say the least Be prepared to watch segments about famine, death and disease. About the only negative other than the persistent tone of misery is that the lead is played by █████████ While he was an exceptionally talented man, it's just a real shame that Hollywood always cast people of European descent to play Asian leads during this era If you are paying attention at all, it's pretty obvious that Muni is wrong for the part.
sanojdoddapaneni	training	Shrek	This is a very beautiful and almost meditative film-there is hardly any dialogue in it, apart from the narration; and the scenery and music compliment each other perfectly I didn't at first connect the red hair of the girl and the fox until it was pointed out to me by a friend (who also has red hair!) It is almost an old fashioned type of children's films, saying that children nowadays prefer animations like █████ or Toy Story etc-but I feel that young people should be introduced more to the beauty and wonder of nature which this film certainly does Maybe not the best ever film of its type but certainly an excellent and relaxing view for all ages -not just children.
sanojdoddapaneni	training	Zombie	I'll be honest with you...I liked this movie It's a great zombie flick that is packed with action, original ideas, good acting, but is also packed with bad ██████ effects Part IV, entitled After Death is also good I would recommend this movie to horror fans everywhere. 10 out of 10 Fans of Horror Movies like this should Check out Puppet Master, Skinned Alive, Slumber Party Massacre, Sleep Away Camp, and other Full Moon Pictures flicks For other recommendations, check out the other comments I have sent in by clicking on my name above this comment section.
sanojdoddapaneni	training	Diane	█████ and I saw this fabulous film today in Fremantle and we both agreed that of the pastiche movies it was head and shoulders above the rest I say that because we were entranced by the brief, five to ten minute segments that composed the film and the fact that this film had a theme around which each piece was composed and of course that theme was love in its many forms.
sanojdoddapaneni	training	Eddie	I like the good and evil battle I liked █████ in this movie better than any movie he has ever done He wasn't The smart, cocky, know it all he usually plays He shows heart and a more humble humor The fact that it shows there are stranger things in Heaven and on earth than we can think of gives me hope.
sanojdoddapaneni	training	Dylan O'Leary	The title says it all. I'm not a film critic nor will I act like the rest of the snobbish people commenting on this movie. Obviously this movie didn't have a multi-million dollar budget, but the plot was very well done, the acting was awesome and the cinematography was great! It looked like you all had a lot of fun making this movie! I voted 9 out of 10 as the sound was strong on only one channel instead of both, but I imagine this might have been an error in the recording of the DVD. I'll definitely be checking out other movies produced by Brain Damage Films!  █████████████, cast and crew, I thank you!
sanojdoddapaneni	training	Corbin Bernsen	There are plenty of up-close shots of mouth-jabbing, tongue-cutting, and beauty queen fondling, as well as a marvelously deranged performance by ██████████████.
sanojdoddapaneni	training	Bozz	The movie manages to put a new spin on an already ancient subject, and manages to distance itself from usual war movies, especially by focusing on an anti-hero from the view-point of traditional standard The movie focuses on the tragic character of ████, who smartly avoids being sucked in by the dehumanizing war machine, and refuses to give up control over his destiny and fight for something he doesn't believe in, spends his energy in searching ways to avoid being sent overseas, both for himself and comrades and ironically ends up finding his own just reason for finally going to war.
sanojdoddapaneni	training	Gena Rowland	Beautiful film, pure Cassavetes style ████████████ gives a stunning performance of a declining actress, dealing with success, aging, loneliness...and alcoholism She tries to escape her own subconscious ghosts, embodied by the death spectre of a young girl Acceptance of oneself, of human condition, though its overall difficulties, is the real purpose of the film The parallel between the theatrical sequences and the film itself are puzzling: it's like if the stage became a way out for the Heroin If all american movies could only be that top-quality, dealing with human relations on an adult level, not trying to infantilize and standardize feelings.. One of the best dramas ever 10/10.
sanojdoddapaneni	training	Werner Henze Simon	Perfect cast for a few-person drama Simon is dead but somehow resurrects from outside What he had seen there is displayed in form of blank spots orchestrated to a magnificent score by German avant-garde composer ██████████████████ is haunted by his death, comforted by support of death people he'd seen on the other side His girlfriend tries to hold him to life but failing to, decides to follow him after his finally occurring death Very touchy and moving, deeply psychological, but a bit slow and somewhere even boring.
sanojdoddapaneni	training	Dean Koontz	███████████ really can't write (I read the book at my sister's recommendation, I should have known better).
sanojdoddapaneni	training	Anthony Bourdain	As ████████████████ said, I wanted to stick my head in a bucket of lye, pull my eyeballs out and jump off a cliff.
sanojdoddapaneni	training	Rea	Citizen X tells the story of The Butcher of Rostov, nickname for a heinous and perverse Russian serial killer who claimed 52 lives from 1978-92 The film focuses on the novice detective (███) who doggedly pursued the killer against all odds in the face of an uncooperative bureaucracy in self-serving and convenient denial An HBO product for t.v., the film offers a solid cast, good performances, spares the audience much of the grisly details, but plays out like a docudrama sans the stylistics of similar Hollywood fare An even and straight-forward dramatization of a serious and comparatively little known story more interesting than Jack the Ripper (B)
sanojdoddapaneni	training	Britons	This is a very worthwhile film for anyone to see, but it is an important one for ███████ and Americans to watch.
sanojdoddapaneni	training	Jim Morris	This is a movie that plays to everyone's emotions We all want a second chance at things ██████████ got one, followed his heart and got a chance to live his dream What a great message and what a great delivery by this movie.
sanojdoddapaneni	training	Bruce Willis	I'm normally a fan of ████████████, and despite him playing the cold-hearted professional killer, I thought him the most appealing character here That said, his character makes such a mess of his professional activity, it's incredible he hasn't been caught before.
deepikamettu	training	David Attenborough	██████████████████ brings his fascination of wild life, this time the creatures under the sea, in this extraordinary 8-episode trip to all the animals under the sea!
deepikamettu	training	Tommy Lee Jones's	The first thing I thought of was when █████████████████ character went to the American Embassy and he saw the holes in the wall on the outside of the building.
deepikamettu	training	Sweeney	Being a D.B. ███████ fan, I've been on the lookout for this movie for quite some time. 
deepikamettu	training	Mars	It is the ultimate PG-13 romp, it is college as we imagine it will be when we're freshmen in high school, it requires so much suspension of disbelief that it may as well be taking place on ████. 
deepikamettu	training	Mamin	█████'s film is truly hilarious, and just "weird" enough constantly keep even the jaded film viewer on his toes.
deepikamettu	training	Shakespeare	I have not read/seen the original and as a rule I can't stand ███████████, but I enjoyed this movie(the civil war setting was very well done as well).
deepikamettu	training	Terry	The way █████ looks at us is hilarious, you can almost pretend you're his accomplice.
deepikamettu	training	Bobby	Especially █████. So if you are wanting to see this movie for the first time I suggest seeing it alone.
deepikamettu	training	Johnny	However, the last scene at ██████'s birthday party was cut way too short.
deepikamettu	training	Millius	███████ is a genius.
deepikamettu	training	Jim	It seemed to me that the soundtrack with speeches, music and the radio was put together so that you feel like you're in the RV with ███, the main character, or in his head.
deepikamettu	training	Micheal	There are a lot of neat little screen shots with ███████ appearing in the background, which adds more of a spooky element to the movie.
deepikamettu	training	Madiba	I think the films made by ██████ are really beautiful.
deepikamettu	training	Charlie	When ███████ walks out of the room to commit suicide he takes his gun with a silencer.
deepikamettu	training	Antoine	My Uncle ███████ is much, much greater than the sum of it's parts.
deepikamettu	training	Bled	But with ████, what you get is not your conventional vampire flick.
deepikamettu	training	Koresh	You won't like ██████ any more after you see this than you did before, but I tend to think that you will come to believe, as I now do, there is much that we were not told about what happened before and during the standoff.
deepikamettu	training	Steele	I know the girl who did the figure skating for the lead girl. She once dated my brother and she was always really nice! I also live in Cranbrook B.C, about 15 or so minutes from fort ██████.
deepikamettu	training	Morris	Who ever put that review as 'of bad taste' is not all quite there... its so funny, genius and fantastic you could watch it until your eyes are square! not to mention the rest of the work he has done on the rest of the series...all is as good as ██████' standards.
deepikamettu	training	Susie	I really like how they break into the bank trying to find █████'s parents information.
deepikamettu	training	Ziegfeld	In real life, ████████ was quite the player but this was sanitized in the American film.
deepikamettu	training	Samantha	"Here On Earth" is a surprising beautiful romantic tale about ████████ who has both boy problems and health problems.
deepikamettu	training	Babylon	Farscape totally rules! In my opinion it's very close to ███████ five although there are only 7 main characters in the series (spaceship included).
deepikamettu	training	Tarantino	It resembles so much to movies like PULP FICTION or RESERVOIR DOGS that is impossible to think that █████████'s films weren't a source of inspiration to this THURSDAY.
deepikamettu	training	Roddenberry	 According to the book THE MAKING OF STAR TREK, in ███████████'s writer's guide to his story writers, he states that any alien creature, no matter how hideously ugly, impossible to believe, benign or malicious, MUST hold some semblance of humanity that the TV viewing public can empathize with and/or relate to.
deepikamettu	training	Stanton	Whether or not their stories are true, and whether ███████ is truly the father or just a crazy old man stepping into their stories, seems impossible to determine.
deepikamettu	training	Brooks	██████ takes these differences and sets them into the volatile setting of a TV news studio, and adds more than a pinch of love interest to the mixture.
deepikamettu	training	Stewart	This is one of those movies that showcases a great actor's talent and also conveys a great story. It is one of ███████'s greatest movies.
deepikamettu	training	Louis	Barring a few historic errors it also does an excellent job of telling the story of the "Spirit of St. █████".
deepikamettu	training	Nikki	I watched this movie for the first time when it was first released and I was about █████'s age and for the longest time I bugged my dad to take me to away somewhere because of course I expected the same thing to happen to me!
deepikamettu	training	Mahler	The music is repetitive, the main theme of the adagietto from ██████'s fifth is used again and again. Yet I would not want to miss a single note. When the last image fades, the last note dies, I am left numb and exhausted.
deepikamettu	training	Elenore	The part with ███████ singing to the little penguin always makes me cry...
deepikamettu	training	Barrymore	█████████ has grown so much as an actress, and it's always wonderful to catch her on the big screen, but this translates well to the small screen, too.
deepikamettu	training	Rob Lowe	This is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. This, in my opinion, is ████████ at his best.
deepikamettu	training	Samuel Goldwyn	██████████████ deserves credit for having the chutzpah to push through a film who has for its leads a disabled vet with pincers for hands, an alcoholic, and an underachiever.
deepikamettu	training	Rainbow Brite	Here's what you have to remember about this movie.... IT'S A KIDS MOVIE!!!!! I don't know about the rest of you but I'm an 80s child. I was obsessed with █████████████.
deepikamettu	training	Nicolas Cage	████████████ at his best. A movie that just has so much character to it, that it makes you realize how sad hollywood has become (as far as quality goes).
deepikamettu	training	Christopher Eccelson	I was a little upset when I found out that ████████████████████ would no longer be playing Doctor Who.
deepikamettu	training	Van Wilder	If you are expecting ██████████, think again.
deepikamettu	training	Chan-Wook Park	I introduced my younger brother to ██████████████ and what a disappointment he got from this.
deepikamettu	training	Jalal Merhi's	I was JUST about to turn the movie off because of █████████████ accent, when it made it to the sex scene, so I thought it might get better, well it did not.
deepikamettu	training	Werner Pochath	Like I said, a very strange movie that is dark and very slow as ██████████████ never talks and just spends his time drinking blood.
deepikamettu	training	Lamberto Bava	This cheapo exploitation flick is some genuinely insipid stuff, courtesy of spaghetti land director █████████████, who wisely left his name off this junk.
deepikamettu	training	Emily Rose	You're much better off just watching The Exorcist or The Exorcism of ██████████.
deepikamettu	training	Nicole Eggert	█████████████ didn't look the part, didn't act the part, and was totally unconvincing as a mountain guide.
deepikamettu	training	Jim Carrey	To begin with its 'star' is a no talent idiot who acts like a bad impersonator of ██████████ who has hoovered enough angel dust up his nose to resurface the Sahara desert.
deepikamettu	training	Mark Hamill	Good to see ███████████ act again.
deepikamettu	training	Jalal Merhi's	I was JUST about to turn the movie off because of █████████████ accent, when it made it to the sex scene, so I thought it might get better, well it did not.
deepikamettu	training	Werner Pochath	Like I said, a very strange movie that is dark and very slow as ██████████████ never talks and just spends his time drinking blood.
deepikamettu	training	Osa Massen	The female character played by ██████████ is just a plot device for the male characters to serve sexist remarks during the entire length of the film.
deepikamettu	validation	Joe Dallesandro	Technically abominable (with audible "pops" between scenes)and awesomely amateurish, "Flesh" requires a lot of patience to sit through and will probably turn off most viewers; but the dialogue rings amazingly true and ███████████████, who exposes his body in almost every scene, also gives an utterly convincing performance.
deepikamettu	validation	Oliver Stone	From ████████████, master of controversial films, there is a piece of cinema which some of us may call crap or others call it art!
deepikamettu	validation	Ben stiller	Stupid! Stupid! Stupid! I can not stand ███████████ anymore.
deepikamettu	validation	Mike Meyers	Too bad ███████████ picked this for his dramatic debut.
deepikamettu	validation	Melody Thomas Scott	The most annoying part of this movie was the acting done by ███████████████████.
deepikamettu	validation	Andrei Tarkovsky	If ████████████████ had been a hack, he would have directed Mother and Son instead of Mirror. This is the single most pretentious film made anywhere in the world, I am convinced.
deepikamettu	validation	Melissa Joan Hart	Ah, and my personal highlight of the movie was the very short appearance of █████████████████ in one scene.
deepikamettu	validation	Sarah Michelle Gellar	I now see why █████████████████████ was barely in the movie.
deepikamettu	validation	Charelston Heston	Moses looked like a criminal in this movie, not like the kind looking man █████████████████ in the 1956 movie.
deepikamettu	validation	Reinhold Messner	Given that one of the film's premises is that 27 or so people have lost their lives on K2, you might think that the jerk in question might have taken a minute or two to bone up on a few basic facts, but the clown seems to think that preparations on this scale, while good enough for the likes of ████████████████, are beneath him.
deepikamettu	validation	Tim Robbins	I would not have thought that ███████████, after having made such good films as "Shawshank Redemption" would have agreed to appear in this film.
deepikamettu	validation	Eric Roberts	I'm sorry for ████████████. Must be tough...I cannot imagine how HUUUGE his mortgage must be to justify taking the job!
deepikamettu	validation	Van Helsing	The main character I thought acted a lot like someone like ███████████.
deepikamettu	validation	Arnold	One of the worst ██████ movies I've seen.
deepikamettu	validation	Jason Lee	█████████ can be hilarious, and he gets a few laughs here and there, but the movie falls flat.
deepikamettu	validation	Chad Lowe	Don't even bother asking yourself why nobody can tell that █████████ is so obviously male, because logic does not apply
deepikamettu	validation	Julian Hernandez	Again, as in Mil nubes de paz, ████████████████ directed an incredibly pretentious film with a story that makes enough argument for a short film of about five minutes but manages to make a 2 hour film with it... 
deepikamettu	validation	Burt Reynolds	This film describes the experiences of a couple of hit men (one of them █████████████), a prostitute, and two drag queens over the interval of a few hours on one night in Miami.
deepikamettu	validation	John Rys-Daves	I am not sure how much ██████████████ got, but most of the money he made should go to his fans as an apology for even being associated with such a ROTTEN movie.
deepikamettu	validation	Drew Barrymore	I'm sure ██████████████ would very much like to pretend this movie never happened.
deepikamettu	validation	Paul Verhoeven's	You'd better choose ████████████████ even if you have watched it.
deepikamettu	validation	Ralph Fiennes	█████████████ has been in some fantastic movies, the English Patient, Schindler's List, but this one was such a let-down.
deepikamettu	validation	Lance Henrikson	I only ended up renting it because it was in the wrong case (I was looking for the Sasquatch film with ███████████████ in it -- still haven't seen that one).
deepikamettu	validation	Peter Jackson's	I might have given this movie a higher rating before ███████████████ trilogy came out, but seeing the two of them side by side there is simply no comparison.
deepikamettu	validation	Matthew Modine	I'm a fan of ██████████████, but this film--which I stumbled upon on cable--is absolutely witless.
deepikamettu	validation	Sean Pertwee	Instead of dropping $30 for this tripe check out a really great recent werewolf pic: "Dog Soldiers" with ████████████.
deepikamettu	validation	Rosanna Arquette	What was ████████████████ thinking?? And what was with all those stock characters in that bizarre supposed Midwest town?
deepikamettu	validation	bob	the little boy actor is probably the most irritating child actor since ███ from house by the cemetery.
deepikamettu	validation	Colm Meaney	The only good actor was ███████████. 
deepikamettu	testing	Eytan Fox	█████████, whilst generally leaning on the apologist side of Israeli politics, has made several quite interesting films in the past such as "Walk on Water" and the simply wonderful film, "Yossi & Jagger".
deepikamettu	testing	Aragorn	I AM glad that ███████ wasn't typecast as an expectant psycho by this P.O.S.
deepikamettu	testing	Elmore Leonard	Though there are elements straight out of ██████████████ territory, this comes closer to an episode of "Dynasty", since the filmmaker focuses on "character development" - i.e. long, boring talks between stupid, un-involving characters.
deepikamettu	validation	Chris Bruno	I watched this because I like ███████████ from "The Dead Zone" TV show and he did his part. He chose a strange accent,
deepikamettu	testing	Laura Gemser	About the only thing this movie has going for it is that ████████████ is in it, but she has a very small part.
deepikamettu	testing	Damon Wayans	It might have been watchable in an extremely dumb way at this point but I found ████████████ voice to be irritating beyond belief .
deepikamettu	testing	Trent Haaga	Hey ███████████, I'm calling you out!
deepikamettu	testing	Andy Copp	I use the word 'apparently' because without listening to a director █████████'s commentary (which I didn't have available to me) or reading up on the film prior to watching, viewers won't have a clue what it is about.
deepikamettu	testing	Susan George	████████████ is fun to watch and yes, she does appear naked.
deepikamettu	testing	Lance Henrikson	I was looking for the Sasquatch film with ███████████████ in it -- still haven't seen that one. The idea of the film is actually a good one.
deepikamettu	testing	James Wood	 ██████████ and Cuba Gooding, Jr. play caricatures of themselves in other movies.
prudhviky	training	John	I am very much looking forward to seeing more of ████'s own scripts and productions.
prudhviky	training	Zeke	████ Rippy (Mic) is great, you totally believe his character. And it's scary as hell, I spent half the movie covering my eyes
prudhviky	training	M. Protsik	██████████ music is as unremarkable as the bad restoration. His accompaniment does not enhance the images at all.
prudhviky	training	John	████ Cusack stars as Hoops in this silly little movie that has to be one of the best of the eighties teen comedies.
prudhviky	training	Rose	████ plays the complexities and shifts of a psychologically disturbed woman really quite accurately. My partner was particularly impressed with the sophisticated way the power exchange issues were handled.
prudhviky	training	Aishwariya	I saw the Bengali version and found that ██████████'s voice was dubbed,which made her dialog delivery a bit poor.
prudhviky	training	Jeanne	 ██████ also addresses his masculine pride perhaps in a feminist take on things.
prudhviky	training	Dostoyevsky	If you liked ███████████'s 'Crime and Punishment," you will probably like this if only for the comparisons.
prudhviky	training	Brenda	her name is ██████, was so fake,, must have been a cGi rat,, looked like a guy dressed up in a beaver suit,, this was pretty schlocky, lame,, but not totally horribble,,
prudhviky	training	Nicolas	I watched this movie for a project on love. please tell ███████  to learn what it would feel like to be his character, and then re-read the lines he's saying.
prudhviky	training	Archer	This ranks as one of the worst movies I've seen in years. Besides Cuba and Angie, the acting is actually embarrassing. Wasn't ██████ once a decent actress?
prudhviky	training	Marx	Do we really need any more narcissistic garbage on the Baby Boomer generation? Technically, I am a Boomer, though at the time when all the "idealistic youths" of the '60s were reading ████, burning their draft cards
prudhviky	training	Richard	the main guy named ███████, who is just way too much of a weakling to even sorta root for.
prudhviky	training	Janeway	The journey was 23 years, but captain ███████ has the power to reduce it...
prudhviky	training	Brett	the lunatic almost had an altar of █████ in her home that could have proved her sick obsession.
prudhviky	training	Lily	Maybe I'm biased to foxes, fox stories and all but I thought this was wonderfully done.<br /><br />I really enjoyed that it was shown when ████ wasn't comfortable,
prudhviky	training	Aladdin	I was watching this with a friend who was amazed at how much Disney's ███████ cribbed from the film.
prudhviky	training	Helena	i thought this movie was really really great! ██████ did an amazing job in it! I thought she played her character very well! she's an AWESOME actress!!
prudhviky	training	Momo	To her surprise he agrees and from then on he is known as ████, her pet.
prudhviky	training	Yeti	I think the best parts of the film are: ████'s body language and the 'special effects.
prudhviky	training	Arkin	 █████ shines as always. Check it out; you won't be dissappointed. By the way, it was just released on DVD and contrary to its packaging, it IS widescreen.
prudhviky	training	Xica	The only thing I would have changed is the end for ████ and her long life love. I can't wait to see it again
prudhviky	training	Judy	I recently watched the '54 version of this film with ████, and while i appreciated the story and music, i found that the film failed to hold my attention.
prudhviky	training	Avril	Its a shame she didn't get screen credit , she by far did the best job in the film has the girl on the cross , best part of the movie .She had much more impact than █████ 
prudhviky	training	Kurosawa	Another demonstration of ████████'s genius, his first colour film is a darkly surreal look into the tragic lives of Tokyo slum dwellers,
prudhviky	training	Stanley	This movie is the best horror movie, bar-none.I love how ███████ just dumps the women into the lake.
prudhviky	training	Olivier	I had really only been exposed to ███████'s dramatic performances, and those were mostly much later films than *Divorce*.
prudhviky	training	Gigi	you can find happiness with "fire and passion" as the main character ████ would say.
prudhviky	training	Ross	An example would be ████ and Rachels future relationship.
prudhviky	training	Davis	Hope █████ really shines in this show. I like the idea of SIX DEGREES...
prudhviky	training	Julia	█████ was excellent playing the psychotic 'man behind the man'.
prudhviky	training	Eddie	█████ is so off the wall that I've been watching this damn show for nearly five years now, and it still rocks every single time.
prudhviky	training	Brosnan	███████ does a good job as the native American with a hidden past and the photography is stunning.
prudhviky	training	Lars	Before Dogma 95: when ████ used movies as art, not just a story. 
prudhviky	training	Casper	The acting styles ran the gamut from really, really, flat (the angels, the wife and daughter) to over-animated (██████'s character).
prudhviky	training	Prizzi	 but I just viewed ██████'s Honor for the first time, on DVD, alone.
prudhviky	training	Bach	████ and her two buddies are certainly beautiful but the movie itself is dull dull DULL!
prudhviky	training	Madsen	ONE good thing of the film is ██████'s performance which manages to bring life to a melo-like one-dimensional character.
prudhviky	training	Cleese	I watched this entire train wreck but only so that I wouldn't later wonder if ██████ had come to his senses in the latter part.
prudhviky	training	Lugosi	██████ was on his downhill slide and it shows. I give this a 1, and this ain't no fun.
prudhviky	training	Bob Dylan's	I think I can safely say that the best part of the movie was the inclusion of ███████████ music.
prudhviky	training	Scott Bakula's	I thought changing ██████████████ eye color did make him seem more cold and menacing than he usually is.
prudhviky	training	Richard Widmark	It stars ███████████████ as a doctor working at a mental institution whose life becomes in turmoil due to family problems 
prudhviky	training	Bogdanavich	This is very little more than a black and white excuse to bore the hell out of the audience even as the egotist ███████████ 
prudhviky	training	christopher walken	the only scenes wich made me laugh where the ones with ██████████████████ in it
prudhviky	training	Herbert Marshall	but thought ████████████████ was a class addition and sat myself down for a good cheesy flick. Boy, was I wrong. Dullsville.
prudhviky	training	Leonard Maltin	I can't believe I waste my time watching this garbage! I did because ██████████████ gave it an "AA" rating,
prudhviky	training	Jessica Simpson	And she thinks ███████████████ is a horrible daisy in fact she thinks she looks more like a slut than daisy duke.
prudhviky	training	Rod Serling	This is a very sophomoric episode, not worthy of the standards of ███████████, but rather an inept attempt at some sort of ironic black comedy.
prudhviky	training	Suess	I hope the ghost of Doctor █████ ghost comes and haunts the people that made this movie.
prudhviky	validation	Michael Moriarty	This was a truly bad film. The character "Cole" played by ████████████████ was the biggest reason this flopped,
prudhviky	validation	Kelly LeBrock	I miss █████████████...<br /><br />--jimbo
prudhviky	validation	Tom Hank's	The fact that they don't clue in to the fact that ██████████ character is flipping into his D&D(oops M&M) :) persona
prudhviky	validation	William H. Macy	Having said that ███████████████ made me grin. Once. <br /><br />2/10. Avoid, unless you enjoy tedium.
prudhviky	validation	Steve Purcell	1st watched 12/7/2002 - 3 out of 10(Dir-█████████████)
prudhviky	validation	Ben Mezrich	I have read the novel Reaper of ███████████ a fews years ago and last night I accidentally came to see this adaption.
prudhviky	validation	Freud	█████ would have a field day.<br /><br />Unless you're one of these mindless "fans," stay the hell away from this abomination.
prudhviky	validation	Dani Behr	In fact probably the most convincing performance came from █████████ of all people,
prudhviky	validation	Harlequin	One doesn't expect much from a Lifetime movie, especially one this old, but this is nearly unwatchably bad.<br /><br />Plot-wise, it's a dreadful, clichÃ©d romance of a type even █████████ would consider beneath them.
prudhviky	validation	Quincy Jones	Also painfully missing is the sharp ████████████ soundtrack that added to much to the original film
prudhviky	validation	Chris Sarandon	I think other reviewers have mentioned this also, namely, what exactly is the nature and motivation of the ██████████████ character
prudhviky	validation	Robin Williams	WIthout ██████████████ it would have gone straight to video. It is poorly written. It is poorly directed.
prudhviky	validation	Slasher	███████ films are often seen as the derivative, repetitive and frankly unoriginal.
prudhviky	validation	Roger Corman	Director ████████████ should be hung from a lightpost so that children can use him as a pinata.
prudhviky	validation	James Spader	With one of my very favorite actors, ████████████, I expected this film to be at least tolerable.
prudhviky	validation	Rhys Ifans	Only ██████████ tries to fill his role with life. Another painful proof that "different" sometimes equals "dreck"
prudhviky	validation	Adam Sandler	If you like ████████████, this is nothing like any other movie he's made.
prudhviky	validation	Chris Kattan	████████████ is so nervous on screen that it made me nervous to watch him.
prudhviky	validation	Hrabal	And when they meet a genius as ██████ the outcome is excellent.
prudhviky	validation	Roy Sheider	 It's surprising to see ███████████ in such an average movie. He's probably the only reason people would rent this movie.
prudhviky	validation	Dan George	I like Chief ██████████, so that was a plus right there. I read a comment from one of the commentors and he mentioned how grainy the picture was
prudhviky	validation	Tony Scott	After seeing "Man on Fire" I was looking forward to a movie from ██████████
prudhviky	validation	Van Dien	██████████ character clearly tries to be Indiana Jones and fails so badly it's not even funny.
prudhviky	validation	Phoebe Cates	an extremely touching ending with a great speech from the old Chinese man and touching speech about why ████████████ doesn't like Christmas.
prudhviky	validation	Ann Biller	██████████ plays Viva, a bored housewife living in LA, during the early 70s.
prudhviky	validation	Quentin Tarantino	What did █████████████████ do? The first part is such an excellent, great, fantastic movie but the sequel is so bad.
prudhviky	validation	Bruce Willis	 ████████████ will always be remembered for starring in this. And rightly so, it is a non-stop thrill ride from about 20 min.
prudhviky	validation	Anthony Quinn	█████████████ is also excellent as a corrupt police captain who has deluded himself into believing that he still has some ethics
prudhviky	validation	mcDonald	Any way, i liked this, and found it to be funny like the rest of mr. ████████'s movies.
prudhviky	validation	Julia Roberts	There is a gay remake of Pretty Woman, with the █████████████ part taken by an Aussie tart with a heart.
prudhviky	testing	Cameron Diaz	The only complaint is the fact that ████████████ can't act!
prudhviky	testing	Lisa Niemi	Also the courage of ██████████ to produce this movie with a very low budget deserves a lot of credit.
prudhviky	testing	Christopher Walken	but I felt fortunate to have stumbled upon this movie. It makes an awesome excuse to take a break from studying every few minutes and stare at ██████████████████.
prudhviky	testing	Wendell Scott	 I had the great pleasure of meeting █████████████ at a car show in the 80's.
prudhviky	testing	Ben Stiller	although as far as I can tell, █████████████ wife is in it
prudhviky	testing	Michael Ironside	If it's got ████████████████ in it, it's definitely going to be bad.
prudhviky	testing	Jackie Chan	That and some BADLY filmed fighting, by a young ████████████████
prudhviky	testing	Rob Bottin	the monsters are cheap ripoffs of the Alien creatures but were done by EFX genius ██████████
prudhviky	testing	Paul Koslo	it`s just an ALIENS clone with only ██████████ treating the film with the contempt it deserves .
prudhviky	testing	Philip Groning's	But give, and you shall receive, as ████████████████ monumental production demonstrates
SSharath-Kumar	testing	Steven Seagal	█████████████ appears to be sleepwalking through a dreadful movie shot almost entirely in close-up to disguise the complete lack of budget and resources
SSharath-Kumar	testing	John Heard	It was actually a shame to see ██████████ play such a great bad guy with a lot of screen time, and the movie be a washout
SSharath-Kumar	testing	John Heard	Hopefully someone important will see it, and at least give ██████████ credit where credit is due, and hire him as lead bad guy again, which is where he should be
SSharath-Kumar	testing	Molly Ringwald	██████████████, well what else needs to be said
SSharath-Kumar	testing	Ally Sheedy	Its a helluva a cast too, check out how heavy ███████████ is.
SSharath-Kumar	testing	Alfred Hitchcock	████████████████ invented any kind of thriller you could think of:he set the standards so high that any director who makes a suspense movie will be fatally compared to him
SSharath-Kumar	testing	Anthony	The director only manages to introduce ███████'s dilemma and eventually brings an easy solution
SSharath-Kumar	testing	Marisa Ryan	Poor ███████████ must be racking up lots of frequent flier mileage as she travels around the country working in these amateur regional films
SSharath-Kumar	testing	Christopher Lee	███████████████ is not only wasted, but he also gives one of his few "I'm here strictly for the money" performances
SSharath-Kumar	testing	Christopher Lee	███████████████ is one of my favorite actors! I'm trying to view all of his work
SSharath-Kumar	validation	Christopher	Please...for the love of ███████████....avoid this film!
SSharath-Kumar	validation	Harry Potter	Some great examples are the ████████████ series, the Lord of the Rings trilogy, and, to a lesser extent, almost every Disney film ever made
SSharath-Kumar	validation	Hillary Duff	It was so bad it should have been ████████████ playing the part, or one of the likes
SSharath-Kumar	validation	Madeline L'Engle	Well, it wasn't just me. Nearly every single one felt the same way--cheated out of the great story that ████████████████ had so skillfully created!
SSharath-Kumar	validation	Peter Jackson	I'm going to write to █████████████ and try to convince him to take on the task!
SSharath-Kumar	validation	L'Engle	I really didn't like this movie because it didn't really bring across the messages and ideas ███████ brought out in her novel
SSharath-Kumar	validation	Madeleine L'Engle	There were some serious differences between the novel and the adapted version and it just didn't do any credit to the imaginative genius that is █████████████████!
SSharath-Kumar	validation	Madeleine Engle	I really was crushed to see the same person ███████████████ that wrote the book and created the movie, made a great book, and a terrible film
SSharath-Kumar	validation	Susan George	████████████ may have been in a couple of movies I enjoy, but I've never considered her the greatest actress I've ever seen
SSharath-Kumar	validation	Susan George	Main points of interest are two feeble decapitations ( 'The Omen' has a lot to answer for in promoting this as a standard horror set-piece ), and the love-making scenes featuring the doe-eyed but extremely kinky ████████████
SSharath-Kumar	validation	Zarchi	Finally, a few reviewers have commended ██████'s so-called documentary style and lack of a soundtrack
SSharath-Kumar	validation	Burt Gummer	Whenever there wasn't any action on the screen you could rest assured that ███████████ was going to be interesting to listen too and/or watch
SSharath-Kumar	validation	Fassbinder	If ██████████ has made a worse film, I sure don't want to see it!
SSharath-Kumar	validation	Fassbinder	I've seen a bunch of ██████████ films and I have found some to be extremely creative and interesting, while others are repellent and self-indulgent messes--like this film
SSharath-Kumar	validation	Fassbinder	I'm honestly at the point after watching this film that I might not bother with any more ██████████ films--the bad seems to be out-weighing the good
SSharath-Kumar	validation	Elvira	The scene in the slaughterhouse and the scene where ██████'s prostitute friend channel-surfs for what seems like ten minutes are just two of the most glaring examples of what makes this film a real test of the viewer's endurance
SSharath-Kumar	validation	Elvira	But what really angers me about it are the few scenes which feature just ██████ and her ex-wife and/or her daughter
SSharath-Kumar	validation	Kathy Bates	Before seeing this movie, I would've said that I loved everything ███████████ has done
SSharath-Kumar	validation	James Woods	███████████ is pathetic...not his character, his acting
SSharath-Kumar	validation	Randy Quaid's	Ditto for █████████████ stereotyping
SSharath-Kumar	validation	Henry Thomas	The only redeeming feature is ████████████, who isn't a strong enough actor to carry this sodden mess
SSharath-Kumar	validation	James Woods	Oh, and word to the wise -- to prove that this is truly an artsy film, you see ███████████ in all his dangly male "look-at-me, I'm-the-figurative-and-literal-representation-of-the-naked-vulnerability-of- man" glory
SSharath-Kumar	validation	Hazel	Only a few rabbits - including his brother █████ - believe him and they set out on a dangerous journey to find a new place to live...
SSharath-Kumar	validation	Barbara Stanwyck	the acting is very good and ████████████████ is great but the the movie has always seemed very trite to me
SSharath-Kumar	validation	Barbara Stanwyck	████████████████ as the mother worships the daughter but the daughter forgoes a mothers love to find happiness with her well to do fathers family
SSharath-Kumar	validation	Stella	██████ is so terribly crude, and never learns better. Her husband is incredibly snobby and small-minded
SSharath-Kumar	validation	Stella	Somehow, ██████ understands that her daughter is ashamed of her gaudy manners & dress, yet cannot understand that she just needs to tone it all down?
SSharath-Kumar	validation	Stella	██████ is a GOOD woman, and a VERY GOOD mother. Giving up herself, so her daughter can be associated with a bunch of bigoted snobs is disgusting.
SSharath-Kumar	validation	Sean Young's	████████████ character is completely unsympathetic. Her performance is wooden at best
SSharath-Kumar	validation	Tom Savini	Anyway, the cover contained blood and weird looking naked girls with fangs and stuff... and ██████████! There is just no way this movie can fail! Right? wrong!!
SSharath-Kumar	training	Jovovich	There are some nice moments, most notably when ████████ sings about Portugal.
SSharath-Kumar	training	Welles	And it was certainly a mistake to feature a visit to ██████' classic The Lady from Shanghai' thus serving to remind us how much better cinema can be.br
SSharath-Kumar	training	Carlito	███████'s Way Rise to Power 1 out of 10.
SSharath-Kumar	training	Hitler	In the second plot, various highranking officers are conspiring to overthrow ██████ and bring the war to an end.
SSharath-Kumar	training	Dick Francis	Yorkshire Television learnt this the hard way when in 1979 they bought the rights to the books credited to ████████████, three of which were broadcast under the collective title 'The Racing Game'.
SSharath-Kumar	training	Robert Morley	Even the late lamented █████████████ playing the part of God couldn't save this stinker.
SSharath-Kumar	training	William Powell	She is exciting and moving here, two things she never was opposite the graceful and refined ██████████████.
SSharath-Kumar	training	John Daniels	All the actors do themselves proud, especially ████████████, must see another of his films.
SSharath-Kumar	training	Sadie Frost	███████████ is totally hot in this movie, and her running around in panties and a tank top after a drugalcohol induced stupor was pretty hot.br
SSharath-Kumar	training	Cinderella	Like SWINGSHIFT ██████████, however, the old lady grandma in this case is dead set on catching the wolf herself and does everything she can do to thwart the wolf from capturing Red.
SSharath-Kumar	training	Sam	It is set up like Smallville or Buffy where there's a 'monster of the week' to beat up but here it is always secondary to ███ just trying to live his life normally.
SSharath-Kumar	training	Armstrong	No, not even for █████████, who should have known better.
SSharath-Kumar	training	Pearl Bailey's	██████████████ part, although small, was not unlike many of our own family members.
SSharath-Kumar	training	any1	and how could evry1 that watched the movie keep calm and silent..am not a religious activist but am not ready to take ████ swear at a Goddess in that manner..br
SSharath-Kumar	training	Milo	The only bad performance was by ████ himself.
SSharath-Kumar	training	Getrumte Snden'	'Succubus', the edited version of 'Necronomicon ███████████████, is a struggle to sit through, even at a lean 76 minutes any more of this dreadfully boring and pretentious Euro horror tripe and I may have slipped into a coma.br
SSharath-Kumar	training	Lang	████ and Harbou are masterful at building suspense, especially at the banquet scene, which is intercut with Verbal's second performance to an amazing effect.
SSharath-Kumar	training	Heifetz	The role of a classical musician like ███████ is to move the audience, not him or herself.
SSharath-Kumar	training	Nguyen	Also, Mr ██████, I guess the parts about the North being the main aggressor it whole war were not shown in your country so to blame America again shows ignorance.
SSharath-Kumar	training	Jason	Obviously the producers knew █████ had to wear the mask so they could put it on the posters, but it would have been less silly if he was just wearing it from the start.
SSharath-Kumar	training	James Earl Jones	████████████████ is, and always has been, a terrific actor.
SSharath-Kumar	training	Errol Flynn	███████████, as a sheepherder
SSharath-Kumar	training	Michael Almereyda	Written directed by █████████████████ I hated just about every second of this supposed film.
SSharath-Kumar	training	Kevin Williamson	Writer ████████████████ was on a roll after penning the successful contemporary teen horror films 'Scream 1996', 'I Know
SSharath-Kumar	training	Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy	In each of the Le Carre' movies I have seen, The Spy who Came in From the Cold, Looking Glass War, █████████████████████████, Smiley's People, and A Perfect Spy, turning and being turned is the foundation of the tragedy.
SSharath-Kumar	training	Julia	My Daughter █████ is 23rd in command of the Planet Earth and a bridge officer.
SSharath-Kumar	training	Julie Walters	Dame Eve Walton is played by the fabulous █████████████.
SSharath-Kumar	training	Xantos	██████, a pacifist with a young and dedicated following, has been imprisoned at Fort Yuma by the Americans.
SSharath-Kumar	training	Max	If the first hour were condensed to 2030 minutes and then the final 20 added on and then another hour added after that, "Mad ███ would be a cool action film with a great vigilante protagonist.
SSharath-Kumar	training	Tom Cruise	In the end, while ██████████ is engaged in a very unrealistic battle sequence on a beach, she roams around aimlessly, considering the possibility of throwing herself off a cliff which would have been a relief.I was going to talk about the extremely pointless car chase sequence between the hero and the chick, in which they demolish their cars for no reason whatsoever, but I don't really know what to say about it.br
SSharath-Kumar	training	Jodorowsky	All things considered, this is a worthy debut of a cinematic genius, a great short film, and an absolute must for my fellow ██████████fans.
SSharath-Kumar	training	Jackie Mason	████████████ shows the saying that "less is more".
SSharath-Kumar	training	Paul Reiser	███████████ did a excellent job as he always has in this movie..
SSharath-Kumar	training	Lancelo	Green is magic, silvermetallic is mankind's power, the forest is a place where ███████ and Guenvere revel in their primitive essence.
SSharath-Kumar	training	Jim McBride	I don't think ███████████ is a bad director, so let's not blame him.
SSharath-Kumar	training	Isabelle Hupert	███████████████ who plays the philanderer with nonchalant distinction offers opprobrium answers like "I don't know" "I like his arms" "I like the way he makes love" to her inquiring husband who tries to kick her out of the house but palliates and reconsiders because...
SSharath-Kumar	training	David Charvet	Obviously,in the end,all the people in the plane are rescued by live helicopters and █████████████ learns to be a better man blah blah blah.
SSharath-Kumar	training	Jack Nicholson	Not even the fact that Dupea is played by the great ██████████████ can mask the truth that the movie which tells his story is downright dull.
SSharath-Kumar	training	Jeff Hardy	Next I feel Regal should have got back his European title, ██████████ is a crappy champ.
SSharath-Kumar	training	Pat	If so god has quite the sense of humor watching ███ make a fool of himself again and again..Before I start...let me say that I fully believe in God.
SSharath-Kumar	training	Fishburne	Second, █████████ is the first black actor to play Othello in a film.
SSharath-Kumar	training	Oliver Stapleton	The cinematographer is ████████████████ who had only photographed some Indy films before Haill Haill Rock Roll but would go on to do such films as Earth Girls Are Easy, The Grifters, The Cider House Rules, Buffalo Soldiers and Pay it Forward.
SSharath-Kumar	training	Luke Wilson	███████████ is good, but he can only do so much.
SSharath-Kumar	training	Hector Perez	In 1963, ████████████ was already a promising young singer in his native Puerto Rico when, at the age of seventeen, he moved to New York City to try and make a name for himself as a performer there.
SSharath-Kumar	training	Williams	What made the case notable was that the ordeal was stretched out over several years and four lengthy trials that highlighted ████████' cunning nature and taxed the patience of even the most benevolent of Savannah's citizens, all of which the filmmakers condense into one trial and a handful of clich courtroom moments.br
SSharath-Kumar	training	Shakespeare	Sure, ███████████'s text can give you goosebumps even when hammered out with selfimportance, but to see a production where true inventiveness makes wonderful words even more so by the provision of context or nuance not found in the stage directions is simply aweinspiring.
SSharath-Kumar	training	Jack Torrence	Then they begin to slowly unravel somewhat like █████████████ in 'The Shining'.
SSharath-Kumar	training	a Lucas Buck	There is ████████████ in every Southern town who has only to make a phone call to make things happen, and the storybook "po' white trash" are all too familiar.
SSharath-Kumar	training	Andy Garcia	███████████ is convincing as the haunted psychologist and superb as the grieving father, so much so that it makes for hard viewing.
SSharath-Kumar	training	Christy	███████ struggles with love, parental attention, questions of self worth and capability.

adityakasturi8	training	Cox	I thought it was not the best re-cap episode I've every seen (though my viewing partner handed me a tissue in anticipation of the Brendan Fraser moment...*sigh*). It was nice to see ███ outside of the incessantly brittle he is in these days, if only for brief moments. I also enjoyed trying to place the episodes included by the length of the character's hair (or height, in case of JD) and the youthfulness of the earliest episodes. I can also see how Zach might be well on the way to a very Chevy Chase/or is that Matthew Perry? prat-fall induced chemical slide (already acknowledged on Conan). A little side note, the song (now stuck in my head) from the janitor-induced dance montage was "Diner" by Martin Sexton.

adityakasturi8	training	Chevy	I thought it was not the best re-cap episode I've every seen (though my viewing partner handed me a tissue in anticipation of the Brendan Fraser moment...*sigh*). It was nice to see Cox outside of the incessantly brittle "Coxism State" he is in these days, if only for brief moments. I also enjoyed trying to place the episodes included by the length of the character's hair (or height, in case of JD) and the youthfulness of the earliest episodes.

adityakasturi8	training	Cox	The only reason I am commenting is because I finally figured out why Dr. ███ was bald. Although we probably all realized it at the same time this week, because they showed these episodes in a different order than they filmed them. The latest episode when our favorite grumpy, Jesus-loving Nurse Roberts dies. For shame, Scrubs. They've made mistakes like this before. I remember when Elliot is trying to date Scott Foley and her hair is wet 2 seconds before water hits her. I try not to notice these things, but my favorite show needs to step it up.

adityakasturi8	training	Salma Hayek	This is just a bad movie. With what seemed to be quite a nice budget it had potential to be much better. It almost were. With the heroine beautiful almost like ███████████, hero fighting almost like Jackie Chan, battles and duels almost like in Crouching Tiger..., music almost like in, say, Conan... etc. Almost. But in the end it's just dull and it is hard to find anything interesting in it. Maybe apart of John Rhys-Davies flying in duel like those warriors in Hero or before-mentioned Crouching Tiger... I am really ashamed of poor old John. He is after all quite a good actor and deserves much better. So as you - so if you still have a chance just watch something else.

adityakasturi8	training	Melissa	when i first started watching these it became one of my favourite shows. ███████ Joan hart is very funny and talented so were the aunts and the other characters and the star of of the show Salem the cat, he was immensely funny. the first few season in my opinion were the best where Sabrina was a teenager in high school adapting to witch life. they were most funniest, most entertaining and most um... good. i'm not a fan of when they started introducing Brad and Dreamer cause i quite liked Valerie, but they were okay the problem was they were only in it for one season. if you're gonna have new people at least keep them.

adityakasturi8	training	Sabrina	I used to love ███████ The Teenage Witch and have seen every single episode. I remember when I used to sit at 6pm every night and wait for it to come on Nickelodeon, however left high school the show began to go downhill. The best series has to be when she was friends with Valerie (I'm not sure which one that is). From there the next series (friends with Dreama) was still really good, but when she left high school it just didn't seem right. All the main characters seemed to have left, which meant that it didn't have as much of the old "sparkle", however the first series where ███████ is in college is still relatively good and watchable, however when her aunt's leave and moves into their house it just isn't right. She is no longer a teenager, so therefore the name of the show isn't right and without Hilda and Zelda and Josh the show just doesn't seem right, especially when nearly marries someone that isn't Harvey.
adityakasturi8	training	Lena Olin	Though I can't claim to be a comic book fanatic, I have read my share, so I guess I'm part of the audience of this film, and I wasn't disappointed. It does run out of steam near the end, it's almost overflowing with ideas, and it seems like █████████, one of my favorite actresses, was left on the cutting room floor. Also, a little of Hank Azaria's Blue Raja can go a long way. Still, it's easy to forgive all of these faults when you have a film which is this much fun. All the actors seem to be having a blast with their roles, especially William H. Macy as the straight-arrow Shoveler, and Janeane Garofalo as The Bowler. And unlike some, I found the design of the city to make the joke even funnier. I also liked how disco was the music of choice of the bad guys; somehow, it seemed appropriate.

adityakasturi8	training	Ben Stiller	In the history of movies based on comic books, "Mystery Men" is one of the most underrated ones. This is no regular comic superhero movie! It follows the exploits of a motley crew of well-meaning wannabes, which include Mr. Furious (played by ███████████), the Bowler (Janeane Garofalo), the Shoveller (William H. Macy), the Blue Rajah (Hank Azariah) and the Spleen (Paul Reubens). "Mystery Men" spoofs several aspects of superhero movies like "Superman" or "Batman," such as the pithy sayings, and the questions about secret identities. Most of the superheroes aren't billionaires like Bruce Wayne, but blue-collar types with menial jobs and neurotic home lives. So it looks as if director Kinka Usher is making the heroes into something the average viewer can relate to. I found "Mystery Men" to be visually stimulating and very funny. Even if it doesn't turn into a franchise, it's still a joy to watch!
adityakasturi8	training	Bachan	I was expecting a lot from Mr.Amitabh ██████'s role of SARKAR, but am disappointed. Being a Ram Gopal Verma's direction i was not ready for this kind of a movie. Sarkar is supposed to be a strong character, but the movie shows that Amitabh is too dependent on others power rather than his. There is a movie in Tamil called Nayakan based on the theme of GOD FATHER and Kamala Hassan has played the lead. The movie is well directed and the power till the end remains in the hands of Kamala Hassan, not his son. Amitab seems to be too helpless in the movie and he just accepts everything instead of changing things. The movie fails to show the strong impact of God Father.

adityakasturi8	validation	Bad Acting	As I watched this movie, I felt as if a plastic bag was slowly closing in around my head. The acting was horribly stifling, and it was ██████████. The most brilliant piece of acting in the entire film was the guy who had to play laid-out-in-state-in-a-coffin. I felt nothing but relief when it was finally over. I was expecting that this film was going to be some real tragedy, with some deep psychological intrigue in the aftermath. All around it was stupid, no beginning, no climax, no ending, just rambling on and on, and the plastic bag kept getting worse. Let's get real here. This is an awful movie.

adityakasturi8	validation	François Coste	Writer-director Patrice Leconte takes a universal and potentially bottomless subject - friendship - and turns it into a flat and meaningless farce, despite A-list actors, fine cinematography and elegant production design. It's all in the plot, and the plot is laughable. "Teach me how to be likable", art dealer ██████████████ (Daniel Auteuil) tells a random stranger (Dany Boon), and that about sums it up. We learn next to nothing about friendship, and Daniel Auteuil may be a fine actor, but not one minute do we believe he could be the cut-throat egoist the script depends on him to be. Just as we hope the travesty is over, Leconte pulls one of his usual cathartic third acts, fast-forwarding from damage to disaster. Like François's treasured Greek vase, everyone and everything in this movie is a fake. Leconte's only asset is Julie Gayet in the part of Coste's business partner Catherine, looking swell and sexy despite a major mishap of a haircut.

adityakasturi8	validation	Allison	I loved the gorgeous Greek scenery but the story, which is not something you can follow anyway, was even harder to follow in the movie. I cannot imagine how anyone watching the movie can get any kind of grip on it if they have not read the book, and then, like me, they would probably wonder why Australian ███████ turned into French Anne, and many other seemingly pointless changes in the story. The mysteries in the book seemed to be chopped up or left out in the movie. I saw it when it first came out and had the same problems with it then, since I had read the book several times. I recently watched it with my granddaughter (very intelligent at 20 and usually into movies I like) who was mostly amazed at how young Michael Caine and Candace Bergen were in it, but otherwise could not imagine why one would watch it except for the scenery.

adityakasturi8	validation	Michael Caine	Since THE MAGUS is a confusing puzzle that really has no solution, one should sit back and enjoy the scenery. Set on a "remote Greek island," it stars a very uptight █████████████ as a teacher working at a school for boys who gets caught up in mind games with local wacko/mystery man Anthony Quinn and his daffy girlfriend Candice Bergen. Quinn, looking like Pablo Picasso with white hair and striped sailor shirt, is actually pretty good but Caine looks like he's ready to explode. Bergen, although stunning, should NOT put on a British accent EVER. She's not very good at that type of thing. Guy Green's direction is fine, but unless you have infinite patience with the circular logic of the film, you will not enjoy it. A real sour note is the casting of the effervescent Anna Karina in the completely joyless role of Caine's girlfriend. After seeing her in the likes of A WOMAN IS A WOMAN and A BAND APART, her presence here is quite jarring.

The truth is that, notwithstanding its base in a true story, its screen play is silly and unbelievable. The real merit of the picture is the cast. A constellation of some of the best supporting players of the 30's and 40's make a background for the delicate, intelligent work of the always underrated Miriam Hopkins, and the wonderful, spectacular performance of Claude Rains, who, as usual, is the best thing in the picture. What an actor! He never won an Oscar, but he is in the good company of Chaplin, Garbo and Hitchcock. Perhaps Lady with Red Hair contains his best work in films. See it and enjoy him.

I also remember the last scene when Jennifer McAllister riped of the killer stomach to get the keys of the truck. It's a movie that gives you the creep and it's worth a look. But where do i find it?

Remember best as the Grumpiest of Old Men as well as the Oddest Couple to have ever made us laugh, Lemmon and Matthau were one of Hollywood's best loved comedy teams of the last 100 years. Not as "raunchy" as Pryor and Wilder, instead, they were the classic comedy team that reflected a more modern Marx Brothers routine. Such as the physical comedy as well as the mixed blend of chaos that Marx, Chaplin and Keaton were so famous for. In the Odd Couple, Lemmon and Matthau play complete opposites that create the chaos. The physical comedy is as unique as Chaplins. The joke is usually on themselves as oppose to passing the joke onto another. Not your typical guy film, it is in a way a coming of age comedy with two old men as oppose to two young teenagers in their prime. The chemistry between Lemmon and Matthau is entertainment enough. Although this movie isn't for everyone, this is a great comedy.

So he invests this overly complicated and needless pointless plan ala SCOOBY-DOO to drive Alan to commit suicide. Most of the movie is him picking up redheads and attacking them. He's not even killing them. He drops off to sleep and the girl vanishes and he thinks he buried them someplace. If he looked at the so-called ghost of Evelyn, he could tell she was wearing gloves! My God what a waste of time. Don't bother watching it, renting and if you bought it and haven't watched it yet, sell it. Quickly! Do yourself a favor and stay away from THE NIGHT EVELYN CAME OUT OF THE GRAVE. I give this stinker the CRAP-O-LANTERN.

The dream child was the worst without a doubt, I was surprised too since they were doing so well with the last two sequels.

The characters are extremely underdeveloped. All in all better than the 6th one, but still one the worst movies of the series. My rating 2/10

Aditya-Rohan-Singh	training	Freddy	Bottom-of-the-██████ barrel. This is the worst film in the series, beating "Freddy's Revenge" for that title. A cheap-looking (with mediocre special effects), incoherent mess, with Freddy turned into a punster. He has one or two cool lines, but that doesn't save this illogical and sloppy sequel.

Beautiful Hong Kong scenery (although some beach scenes look studio-bound), a famous title tune, poetic script, lovely background music (by █████████████), great costumes, outstanding performances, especially Jones (directed here by Henry King, who also did "The Song of Bernadette - 1943, an Oscar for Jones) still make this a world-class romance weeper.

Aditya-Rohan-Singh	validation	Ryan Phillippe	This movie was good. I can't say it was one of the best, but it still was good. The only reason that I watched it was because of ██████████████. He is soo hot! (Don't get mad Reese). But I think that it was sort of funny- not a laugh your head out kinda thing, but still O.K.

Well locate this little sleeper. ████ Lithgow and Billy Bob Thorton are great in this little plot twister. Don't forget the cameo by Jamie Lee Curtis.

It deserves a theatrical re-release.

Aditya-Rohan-Singh	validation	Billy Bob	After seeing the trailer it was an easy decision not to see this film. I mean, I don't care for stupid "stoner comedies." I'm sure it was also an easy choice for a lot of people to get together, smoke a bowl and go check out this flick with the guy from The Simpsons and some guy named "█████████." Should have been a good time, but the film's just not that funny--too bad somebody had to go and bum their high. 
Aditya-Rohan-Singh	validation	Ryan Philippe	This is an awesome movie, and if you haven't seen it, you should go to the video store right now and rent it. First off, the cast is superb. Not only does it have current stars, like █████████████ and Billy Bob Thornton, but it also has your stars of yesteryear like Judge Reinhold. It also has numerous cameos by actors like Jon Bon Jovi, Ted Danson, and Jamie Lee Curtis. Second off, the story was quite good also. It was interesting how they took a plot for a stoner movie, and almost made it dramatic. It takes the drug situation in the United States, and instead of giving it a comedic face like in "Half Baked" it has a true, life lesson image like "Traffic". So watch this movie, if you're a stoner it will give you insight into something you love, if you don't do drugs it will give you a more realistic view of drugs than either side wants you to see.

Aditya-Rohan-Singh	validation	John Lithgow	The first half hour of "Homegrown" was rather boring and not absorbing, but as the film progressed, so did my interest in the characters and the plot. Several scenes are really scary and you fear for the main characters who you actually grow attached to. The story is about three hired hands on a hidden illegal marijuana farm in southern California. They witness the murder of the farm's owner, Malcolm (████████████), and they take over the weed for their own. The three rather simple-minded farm hands soon get swept up into a scary world of mafia and local interest, while all of the time trying to convince everyone that Malcolm is still alive. While the movie had several faults and a slow beginning, it turned out to be worthwhile. 7/10 stars.

Although AIDS is supposed to be the main theme, the strong sup-text of friendship and love, as they evolve between Eric and Dexter, is a powerful message for teenagers. Writing prompts centered around the symbolism of the tennis shoe are particularly effective. I also suggest directed class discussion about how Eric evolves from manipulative user to loving friend.

Aditya-Rohan-Singh	validation	Hillerman	This film for me and my wife is more entertaining than all the bloc-buster violent thriller/mystery/murder movies that abound. It is about real people making the best of their lives. They just happen to be Indian and the main characters are in law enforcement. The realistic acting and the great scenery more than make up for the slightly implausible plot. The sound track is by BC Smith, who also did the soundtrack for Coyote Waits, and is great.

There are many other fine either supporting or cameo roles by Graham Greene, Tantoo Cardinal, etc. We have also seen Coyote Waits, another adaptation of a █████████ novel, and we greatly enjoyed it too.

josudha10	testing	Ben Mezrich	I have read the novel Reaper of ███████████ a fews years ago and last night.
josudha10	testing	Schlesinger	Meant to be some sort of a social commentary about the way that our lives were spinning out of control in the 1970's, this movie plays more like something Mr ███████████ threw together after having a bad day on the freeway.

josudha10	testing	Bill Hicks	Since a remake is apparently in the works, it can probably be expected that the charm of the original will get lost along the way and will get replaced by vulgar, half-funny dick jokes, as ██████████ used to call them.

josudha10	training	Madsen	This has to be the worst movie I have seen ██████ fans don't be drawn into this like I was.

josudha10	training	Igor	Cinema after all is a visual media and ████ used its full potential.
josudha10	training	Wally Cox	Mr Peepers is just as charming as when I first saw it (5-years old at the time) and █████████ is truly endearing in this role.
josudha10	training	Bette Davis's	Interesting in that █████████████ plot line is essentially back story!
josudha10	training	George W Bush	This end credits sequence of imagined news bulletins may be the first information some younger viewers are exposed to about WWII, leading them to the conclusion that █████████████ is the latest heir to the Nazi throne.

josudha10	training	La Momia	There's also another thing - watching ████████ can give you a clue what was the whole SF/Horror genre concept back in the fifties.
josudha10	training	Vincent	My family was paid to leave our campsite for the afternoon, when they filmed ███████ floating down the river.
josudha10	training	Shakespear	The whole thing feels a little like a fantasy, perhaps ██████████'s Midsummer Nights Dream.
josudha10	training	Danny	The skilled use of innovative resources (like stills stitching █████'s memories into the film) will compare to those hand-made pieces of work so rare and so enjoyable.
josudha10	training	Steven Spielberg	I'm a complete book worm/nerd/geek/whatever, but why? Just get the ████████████████ version.
josudha10	training	Antonio Sabato Jr	I didn't expect much from this TV movie You have to set the bar lower than you would for midget limbo for any TBS movie starring █████████████████.
josudha10	training	darby	During the live ramones set, notice that █████ crash of the germs is in the front of the crowd neat-o.
josudha10	training	Gigli	In summary, this movie could very well make a claim to being the worst film released in recent times I have not seen █████ or some of the other recent flops but this one, because of it's poor quality in every respect, must easily be worse then anything that mainstream.
josudha10	training	Eddie	I like the good and evil battle I liked █████ in this movie better than any movie he has ever done.
josudha10	training	Dylan O'Leary	█████████████, cast and crew, I thank you!
josudha10	training	Corbin Bernsen	There are plenty of up-close shots of mouth-jabbing, tongue-cutting, and beauty queen fondling, as well as a marvelously deranged performance by ██████████████ The scene in which he ties up and gases his wife before mercilessly yanking her teeth out is definitely hard to watch.
josudha10	training	Gena Rowland	Beautiful film, pure Cassavetes style ████████████ gives a stunning performance of a declining actress, dealing with success, aging, loneliness.
josudha10	training	Werner Henze Simon	Magnificent score by German avant-garde composer ██████████████████ is haunted by his death, comforted by support of death people he'd seen on the other side.

josudha10	training	Charlton Heston	It really got me thinking about a world without vegetation or livestock and made me appreciate the world I live in a lot more ███████████████ does a good job.
josudha10	training	Majkowski	Filmmakers like █████████ (hope I got that right) deserve the chance to strut their stuff to a wider audience.
josudha10	training	Mary Poppins	This and ████████████ are added to my collection. Just as I had remembered!
josudha10	training	Roy Scheider	This is a good enough movie and you probably won't be disappointed, but it again has ████████████, right after he did "French Connection", playing a cop with the name Buddy.
josudha10	training	Northfork	At first glance a film like █████████, a town set to be flooded in 1955 and a group of 6 characters who are sent out to evacuate the remaining townspeople, could be just an ordinary film.
josudha10	training	John Waters	Trouble by ███████████ and that was even worse. The dialogues, the acting, it really stank.
josudha10	training	Bennett	Especially Ocean himself for bowing down the ███████.
josudha10	training	Nicolas Cage's	Perhaps its the lack of research that went into ██████████████ character's 'punk' persona or just the cheesiness factor because it was such a typical eighties film.
josudha10	training	Dave Grohl	What I was most surprised about was ██████████ as Satan That is f-ing hilarious.
josudha10	training	Columbo	Most definitely the worst ███████ ever dreamt up No murder and the abandonment of the tried and tested formula makes this a real drag.
josudha10	training	Debbie Boone	The end result is a prefab love story of predictable schlock, all obviously thrown together in a crassly commercial attempt to wring a few more bucks from the contemporary ████████████ hit Yep, that's how fast it was produced.
josudha10	training	Roxy	Crew provide the best scene in the film when they dominate a dance battle at the premiere breakdancing club of the early 80's, the ████.
josudha10	training	Jeff Goldblum	Number 2 is best summed up by █████████████ in the movie about being the stupidest idea in the history of stupid ideas (or something like that).
josudha10	training	Robert Wagner	█████████████ is the evil boss of Digicron, a telecommunications company with a virus that kills people.
josudha10	training	Michael Moore's	I browsed the variety of terrible films they had to offer while he went off in search of ███████████████ Sicko.
josudha10	training	Freud	The majority of them teenage girls with a pathological adoration for anything androgynous █████ would have a field day.
josudha10	training	Gary Lewis	The performances are excellent, particularly that of ██████████ who gets better with every role My only criticisms are that it is a bit on the long side and could have done with a touch more humour to offset the darker moments.
josudha10	training	Brad Pit	If you liked the film Se7en (Seven) with ████████ or The Matrix then you will like this.
josudha10	training	Michael Jackson	Characters with absolutely no depth, fitting into a stereotyped roll they never escape for a moment, teenagers trying to survive a slaying by some mysterious force they disturbed by doing something lamely adolescent, completely gratuitous nudity, impossible amounts of blood coming out of victims, slow moving zombies, great one-liners.. and our hero even wears a ███████████████ jacket.
josudha10	training	Columbo	The script for this ███████ film seemed to be pulled right out of a sappy 1980's soap opera.
josudha10	training	patrick rea	I've never been the biggest fan of ███████████ this guy just does not know how to make movies.
josudha10	training	Kimi	████ wa petto is a cute story about a girl who one day finds a boy inside a box that is outside her apartment.
josudha10	training	Alec Guinness	This was my first exposure to the young █████████████, and it's obvious from the first frames what made him so special as to eventually receive a knighthood.
josudha10	validation	Arnold	Running Man with ██████ instead. At least it had a semi good ending.
josudha10	validation	Sandra Bullock	The actors' performance is globally OK, ██████████████ usually annoys me with her "oh my god why me way to behave, but this time she seems to have controlled herself.
josudha10	validation	Adolf Hitler's	The violent clash between ██████████████ Germany and Soviet Russia, from 1941-45.
josudha10	validation	Bogart	A useless happy ending deluges what impact the scene prior hard but is still good WB would later make this same movies with ██████ in the Cagney/fatherly role.
josudha10	validation	George	This show was absolutely terrible For one ██████ isn't funny, and his kids are snobby little brats He also treats his mother with no respect.
josudha10	validation	Vin Diesel	Never realizing it was a horror flick and who was this gorgeous,baritoned voiced hunk, named ██████████.
josudha10	validation	Dolemite	████████ may not have been the first black exploitation flick to come along but it certainly is one of the best.
josudha10	validation	Flash Gordon	You've got to see these human-robots as they look like the enormous clunky robots from ████████████ and other serials.
josudha10	validation	Matt Newton	Five groups of friends on their way to schoolies I've got to say that ███████████ as Mason was probably my favourite character.
josudha10	validation	This Robert Altman	A notorious big budget flop when released ██████████████████ inspired comedy has some terrific moments and an occasionally inspired cast.
josudha10	validation	Victor E Frankl	I recommend that you also read Man's Search For Ultimate Meaning by ███████████████ I think you will be able to draw some amazing correlations.
josudha10	validation	Ms Xavier	█████████ appears to be a very attractive female It is too bad the R rating did not allow much of her to be seen.
josudha10	validation	John Thaw	The performances are outstanding here especially by the embittered █████████, who is assigned a child who has been evacuated from the London bombing.
josudha10	validation	Gretchen Moll	South who's momma wouldn't let her date until she married, who moved to New York and ended up becoming the most successful pin-up of her age, is driven by an outstanding performance from █████████████.
josudha10	validation	Russell	I have to say I quite enjoyed Soldier ███████ was very good as this trained psychopath rediscovering his humanity.
josudha10	validation	Lucille Ball	She is not only gorgeous but hilarious in this film (I believe that ████████████ may have modeled her later career on Davies' style.
josudha10	validation	Simon	This movie's about █████'s adventures The special effects, plot, acting, and generally everything about this movie is BAD.
josudha10	validation	henson	██████ is just so very missed?
josudha10	validation	Alec Guinness	Americans have little knowledge of his work other than Star Wars, █████████████ produced an amazing body of work.
josudha10	validation	Sabrina	It's really great to see MJH in a different role than her ███████ character.
josudha10	validation	Angelina Jolie	I have wanted to see this movie for about a year now because I knew ██████████████ was in it.
josudha10	validation	Nigel Marvin	Including it's ████████████ spin-offs, for all their gleeful fun yet informative information.
josudha10	validation	Goldberg	Aside from the poor premise the acting isn't the best either, ████████ gives a mediocre performance as does the remainder of the cast.
josudha10	validation	Sammo Hung	Yeah right ██████████ already acted in the main role in 1983's.
josudha10	validation	Walter Pidgeon	In FP, ██████████████ is clearly the chimera- himself and his monster.
josudha10	validation	Robert DeNiro	9/11, hosted by █████████████, presents footage from outside and inside the Twin Towers in New York, on September 11, 2001.
josudha10	validation	Newhart	Every thing had been in the mind of an autistic child ███████ ended by telling us that it had all been a dream.
josudha10	validation	jay walker	There's a fairly gory scene of someone coughing blood all over a nurses face and a very impressive ██████████ getting run down stunt.
josudha10	validation	Paul Keenan	Also, this movie proved that actor ███████████ (Dynasty/Days of our Lives) was off to a great start.
josudha10	validation	Andie MacDowell	It was funny and sad and yes, the guy ███████████████ shagged was hot.
satanu22ou	training	Landlord Edgar Kennedy	They also made other line-up changes with substituting ██████████████████████ with Landlord Charlie Hall.THE second reworking of the hidden animal premise is the 3 Reeler, THE CHIMP (Roach/MGM, 1932), which substituted a female ape from a dissolved and defunct Circus, to which Stan and Babe were former employees.
satanu22ou	training	Jennifer Jason Leigh	████████████████████ stars as a game designer (Allegra) who creates a virtual-reality game that taps into the players' minds as we can see on the movie main details page.
satanu22ou	training	Tom Courtenay	The Dresser is a small but absolutely wonderful film, brilliantly acted by Albert Finney and █████████████.
satanu22ou	training	Leandro Lucchetti	Un Gatto nel Cervello/Cat in the Brain is one of the goriest horror movies ever made.There is a lot of blood and gore,including chainsaw butchery,bloody stabbings and numerous decapitations.The film is also interesting as self parody of Fulci,but the gore and violence is the key element in it.Some of the gore FX were taken from own Fulci's movies Quando Alice Ruppe lo Specchio and I Fantasmi di Sodoma(both 1988),plus gore FX taken from Fulci-supervised The Snake House aka Bloody Psycho by █████████████████,Massacre by Andrea Bianchi,Non Avere Paura Della Zia Marta by Mario Bianchi,Non Si Sevizia i Bambini by Giovanni Simonelli and Luna di Sangue aka Fuga dalla Morte by Enzo Milioni(all 1989).The scene where Brett Halsey beats the woman's face to pulp is from Quando Alice Ruppe lo Specchio,a film Fulci had made for Italian TV in 1988.The chainsawing of the female corpse at the beginning is taken from the same film,as is the head in the microwave and the guy that gets driven over and over again.Highly recommended,especially if you like extreme cinema!
satanu22ou	training	Jill Johnson	), I was excited to see this remake.Camilla Bell did a great job as ████████████.
satanu22ou	training	Ronald Sanders	)The nod to good taste by getting Peter Suschitzky's cinematography, Howard Shore's music and ██████████████'s editing (a team that wins).
satanu22ou	training	Andy Rodoreda	**SPOILERS** Looking for a little more excitement then seeing crocodiles being fed at the local game reserve sisters Grace and Pat, Diana Glenn & Maeve Dermody, together with Grace's boyfriend Adam, █████████████, decide to take a trip upstream in the desolate and deserted, of human habitation, Australian Mangrove Swamps.With their swamp guide Jimmy, Ben Oxenbuld, at the helm of his motorized boat the four get upended by a giant saltwater crocodile who quickly grabs and drags a terrified Jimmy down to the bottom along with him.
satanu22ou	training	Mark Borchardt	At one time in my life I was trying to make films, and experienced many of the same problems ██████████████ did in trying to make HIS film.
satanu22ou	training	Tom Arnold	I again watched it the other night with ██████████ in it.
satanu22ou	training	Heath Ledger	Set in Sydney's notorious King's Cross district (where prostitution, drug abuse and sex stores thrive), it tells the story of Jimmy (played by ████████████).
satanu22ou	training	Michael Curtiz	With a director the caliber of ██████████████, the film is better than it might have been under someone else.
satanu22ou	training	Mimi Kinkade	A bunch of mostly obnoxious and grossly unappealing teens go to a creepy, remote, rundown old mortuary located nearby a cemetery to attend an anything-goes all-out Halloween party being hosted by freaky occult-obsessed oddball ████████████ and her vacuous, boy-hungry bimbette friend Linnea Quigley.
satanu22ou	training	Renee Zellweger	███████████████ (Jerry Maguire) not only holds her own in this exalted company but shines as Streep's daughter, who learns to see in a new light her parents' lives as well as her own.
satanu22ou	training	Martin Niemoller	████████████████, 1945When faced with intolerance or injustice, the easiest thing to do is nothing - speak up and you risk becoming an object of scorn.
satanu22ou	training	Martin Niemoller	████████████████, 1945When faced with intolerance or injustice, the easiest thing to do is nothing - speak up and you risk becoming an object of scorn.
satanu22ou	training	Cristina Marsillach	And a main reason why Argentos becoming one of my favorites.The acting from most of the cast was alright, but the best by far was ███████████████████ as the tortured young opera singer Betty.
satanu22ou	training	John Malkovich	As for Leary (██████████████), he was a sick man who loved to toy with Frank by phone.
satanu22ou	training	Sebastian Gutierrez	As writer and director, ███████████████████ deserves high praise.
satanu22ou	training	Andreas Kunze	Baxter, then, is finally caught attempting to escape to Rio de Janeiro on a plane.Always worth special mention is █████████████ who in this case plays 00's wife, as he's usually appearing in drag performing women's roles in Helge's Movies.So all you folks out there looking for new laughs, I strongly recommend this movie.
satanu22ou	training	Hal Havins	Bloodthirsty highlights include disgusting fat slob ██████████ (who played a similarly irritating obese a**hole role in the immortal Sorority Babes in the Slimeball Bowl-A-Rama around the same time) having his tongue bitten off, Quigley shoving a whole tube of lipstick in one of her breasts (yow!)
satanu22ou	training	Cole Wlikerson	Brian Keith as ██████████████ and Richard Jaeckel as Wade Matlock make excellent villains.
satanu22ou	training	Kirk Douglas	Clint Eastwood scores big in this thriller from 1993.Teamed with an absolute master of edge of your seat suspense,Wolfgang Peterson, Eastwood delivers as only he can.Also,John Malkovich goes on my list of most effective screen villains in the history of cinema as the demented assassin.As for Rene Russo as Clint's love interest,I think ████████████ said it best when he said,referring to his own career,I keep getting older,and my leading ladies keep getting younger.This film is a very effective thriller with enough plot twists and surprises to keep you going.Eastwood and Peterson should team together more often.
satanu22ou	training	Claude Rains	Curtiz made sure no scene, soapy or otherwise, went on too long.In addition to the Lane sisters and Garfield, we have ████████████ (who adds much-needed humor to the story), Jeffrey Lynn (the main love interest of the girls), Gale Page, Dick Foran, Frank McHugh and Mae Robson.Apparently, this movie must have been a hit because there were several spin-offs from it, neither of them approaching this one in content and box-office success.
satanu22ou	training	Tom Atkins	Diehl (██████████) makes his first appearance on the series and Dennis is quietly demoted from a police lieutenant that he was on the earlier season one episodes to a police Sargent.
satanu22ou	training	Spike Feresten	Either way, it was funny as hell.I do not expect ██████████████ to read these pages, but maybe he does.
satanu22ou	training	Dario Argento	Even though it's part of Italian giallo; which is far from being a slasher sub-genre.█████████████ proves that he deserves the label of one of the best directors in Horror.
satanu22ou	training	Phil K. Dick	Everything he does have a meaning and is surrounded by details : The nod to ████████████ (who wrote In The Days of Perky Pat) by creating a 'Perky Pat' fast-food restaurant.
satanu22ou	training	Evan Richard	Faults do pop up in the story, as it does lose that furious grip it held so early and goofy humour (or better putter comic relief) between Fay Ripley and ████████████'s characters is a hit and miss affair by being too forceful.
satanu22ou	training	Steve Johnson	Fortunately, Kevin S. Tenney's slick, assured, stylish direction keeps the extremely threadbare and derivative proceedings thundering along at a speedy clip; moreover, Tenny gives the film an attractive polished look and effectively creates a certain crudely energetic and enthusiastically grotesque spooky ooga-booga carnival funhouse atmosphere.However, █████████████'s marvelously gory and imaginative make-up effects are the true star of the show.
satanu22ou	training	Hector Cordoba	General ██████████████ is setting up as near-emperor in Northern Mexico, and steals a huge cannon from General Blackjack Pershing.
satanu22ou	training	Valerie Harper	Gerald McRaney is excellent, a familiar face for Lifetime viewers; ██████████████ is also good; since this film was made in '88 maybe the writer should produce a sequel!.You will also enjoy Barry Corbin as the town eccentric, and Darryl Anderson as a Bruce Dern-lookalike/crazed military man.While the story plot is a bit over the top; if you are a movie buff you will be reminded of similar scenarios from Psycho; Deliverance; as well as other horror stories of that genre.
satanu22ou	training	Anita Mui	He is married for 20 years to Ching (the great █████████, in her last role before she was cruelly taken from us), and it appears to be a loving relationship.
satanu22ou	training	Bill Murray	He should have been involved to the tune of how much screen time ███████████ got in the first one.
satanu22ou	training	Charles Korvin	Her husband ██████████████ has left her flat, the unkindest cut of all being that he was fooling around with her sister while she was in Cuba collecting the gems and contracting smallpox.
satanu22ou	training	John Garfield	I am referring to Priscilla, Rosemary and Lola Lane.Why national critics loved this movie was the presence of bad-boy-rebel █████████████.
satanu22ou	training	Cindy Crowford	I confess that Spike really bribed me, but I must also confess that Rockefeller named me in his will and last night I had sex with ██████████████.
satanu22ou	training	Errol Morris	I have been a huge ████████████ fan ever since I saw Thin Blue Line and heard it saved a life.
satanu22ou	training	Samuel L Jackson	I have my doubts.Not for the first time, ████████████████ plays so well that we forget we're watching Samuel L Jackson; the man is unbelievably good.
satanu22ou	training	Tarantino	I honestly believe that █████████ was heavily influenced by this specific movie with certain scenes in Kill Bill Vol.
satanu22ou	training	Mel Gibson	I mean, it was not like ██████████ or Bruce Willis would do it, he was sensitive and modest.
satanu22ou	training	Frankie Muniz	I normally can't stand █████████████ but he is just fine here.
satanu22ou	training	Sean Connery	I particularly enjoyed Hotspur and Hal, whom I now see were played by ████████████ and Robert Hardy.
satanu22ou	training	John Cassavetes	I would certainly recommend this film to anyone who has an interest in Avant Garde film makers such as Andy Warhol, ███████████████, or Jim Jarmusch.
satanu22ou	training	Aidan Quinn	I'm glad that ███████████ got this opportunity to show another side of him (in fact two, because he plays the villain as well), even although the film wasn't that successful.
satanu22ou	training	Karen Mills	It begins with Jim returning from a weekend trip with a new girlfriend, the recently divorced ███████████ (Pat Delaney--daughter in law of John Huston, who knew a few things about noir film) and her daughter.
satanu22ou	training	Glenn Ford	It's a pity that goody-goody ██████████ gets in their way.
satanu22ou	training	Craig Brewer	It's not about black/white relationships or old/young relationships, though I think director ████████████ deliberately threw in both elements to tweak imagined taboos.
satanu22ou	training	John Woo	It's resolutely silly and juvenile, so if you want a good bit of serious Hong Kong action, look to a ████████ or Yuen Woo Ping movie.
satanu22ou	training	Joan Cusack	It's skillfully written, Kevin Kline and ███████████ are both perfect in their roles, and if you can look at Bob Newhart in this movie and not chuckle, you're more of a man than I.For that matter, I think the scenes where Tom Selleck kisses Kevin Kline, where Kevin Kline listens to the How to be a Man cassette, and the post-(almost-)wedding scenes w/ ███████████ are three of the funniest scenes in any movie.Sure, the last scene is a bit of an excuse for a happy ending, but...few movies are perfect.
satanu22ou	training	Catherine Deneuve	I've slowly been collecting the films available on DVD of both █████████████████ and Francois Truffaut.
satanu22ou	testing	Connie Gilchrist	Keep an eye out for good performances by ████████████████ as Evelyn's unsympathetic landlady, Jim Backus as a shifty club owner, and Art Smith as Korvin's fence.A real sleeper in the noir category, don't miss it if broadcast.
satanu22ou	testing	Angelina Jolie	Kiefer Sutherland, Colin Hanks, Tori Spelling and ██████████████ are all offspring of big-time film or TV people; no doubt, they will all want to direct some day, if they aren't already.
satanu22ou	testing	Don Quixote	Like ███████████, he seems so inept and self-deluded that he doesn't realize how bad off he really is.
satanu22ou	testing	Rudy Ray Moore	Lord, ██████████████ and D'Urville Martin really put this one together didn't they?
satanu22ou	testing	Matthew Modine	Michelle Pfeiffer and ██████████████ are a joy to watch in this screwball comedy.
satanu22ou	testing	Charley Chase	MIGHTY LIKE A MOOSE leaves the viewer with a warm glow, and surely ranks with the most amusing comedies produced by the prolific, sadly underrated █████████████.
satanu22ou	testing	Yukio Mishima	Mishima: A Life in Four Chapters is an art-house biography about █████████████, celebrated Japanese writer, who bears resemblance to Paul Schrader's earlier character Travis Bickle (Taxi Driver): both of them are lonely people searching for their place in their society and when they realize that world doesn't need them, they try to destroy their surrounding universe.If you want to learn about life of Mishima, then you won't find a lot of information here, because it shows that he didn't live a very interesting life (except for his final day), but if you want to understand his personality, then it is the best movie of its kind, as most of the movie is adaptation of his novels and also provides a guide to his thoughts.
satanu22ou	testing	Wonder Showzen	My girlfriend was gonna get an abortion until we both watched ██████████████ one night.
satanu22ou	testing	Charles Darwin	Nevertheless, the movie as ██████████████, still sees wonder and beauty beyond God in the universe of infinite Evolution.
satanu22ou	testing	Bryan Brown	On that night as well, Jimmy is first contacted by Pando (played by ███████████).
satanu22ou	testing	John Larch	Other stalwarts in the class include ██████████ and John Russell.
satanu22ou	testing	James Gandolfini	Peter Boyle, then about 35, plays Joe (the bigot), and he looks like ████████████████.
satanu22ou	testing	Audrey Hepburn	Russian actress TATIANA SAMOILOVA reminds me so much of the young ██████████████ and the camera in THE CRANES ARE FLYING seems to love her just as much.
satanu22ou	testing	Jean Louis Tringtignat	since the characters are completely realistic and they're not clichéd in any way and one could expect no less from the actors and one doesn't get disappointed... seriously I believe ██████████████████████ deserved an Oscar nod at least.The music from Zbiegnew Preisner is amazing it's one of the best musical scores ever.
satanu22ou	testing	Susan Fletcher	Society heiress ██████████████ (Hopkins) and her wealthy father Simon Fletcher (Henry Stephenson) are vexed that their young nieces Joan (Betty Philson) and Katie (Marianna Strelby) are living a Bohemian lifestyle in Greenwich Village with their artist uncle John (Milland) after the death of their parents (Susan's sister and John's brother).
satanu22ou	testing	Jesus Ponce	Spanish novel director ███████████ creates one of the most perfect gallery from the latest year of Spanish cinema.
satanu22ou	testing	John Savage	Starring ███████████, Treat Williams and Beverly D'Angelo.
satanu22ou	testing	Guy Ritchie	Stylistically, if you like Quentin Tarantino or ███████████ movies, you should be in tune with what to expect...twists and turns and black comedy.What's so great about this movie is its very 'Australian-ness'.
satanu22ou	testing	Spike Feresten	Talkshow with ██████████████ is one of those shows that will definitely polarize audiences.
satanu22ou	testing	Mao Tse Dung	That, based on the hammer and sickle, could only have been the People's Revolutionary Army of ████████████!!!
satanu22ou	validation	Edgar Kennedy	The comic moments that follow are generated with the interplay between L & H and slow-burn exponent, █████████████, their Landlord.
satanu22ou	validation	Marina Zudina	The delicate █████████████ gives a harrowing portrayal of the American mute girl Billy.
satanu22ou	validation	Alan Rickman	The efforts of a new group of young talent bolstered by ████████████ and Emma Thompson, 2 extremely gifted actors, makes for a thrilling and engrossing evening of entertainment.
satanu22ou	validation	Emile Zola	The film takes its own matters and mixes them with classic European literature, in this case ██████████'s Thérèse Raquin.
satanu22ou	validation	Justin Kerrigan	The movie was made on a miniscule budget and I look forward to future offerings of Writer/Director ███████████████ when his talent is discovered by the major movie makers.
satanu22ou	validation	Oleg Yankovsky	The performances by the cast were all fine, especially the nail biting turns by ██████████████ and Igor Volkov as the Russian murderers.This riveting feature that's mostly made up of unknowns, is way better than your average dark thriller.
satanu22ou	validation	James Whitmore	The uncivilized Mature lusts for the colonel's wife, giving the film an interesting and even dark subplot which goes so far as to reference coveting another man's wife at one point by ██████████████ who plays Mature's older and wiser mountain man father figure.
satanu22ou	validation	Ritchie	There is great chemistry between Ledger and Byrne in this movie-so, on one level, it functions as nice love story.This movie doesn't have some of the horror of Tarantino and ███████ underworld movies, but it does have some adult themes...scenes that surprise you with their coldness and beauty.
satanu22ou	validation	Yevgeny Nourish	They play transcendenz during an hour or so (in this game, there's a game (eXistenZ) in which JJL plays eXistenZ's genius programmer and Jude -Pikul - Law a marketing trainee associated with Allegra's game), they play eXistenZ because Allegra is very concerned about her pod's health (the thing you plug your nervous system in, in order to play), she has to plug herself and Pikul in then wins the game (Transcendenz) and back in the reality they kill ███████████████, TranscendenZ programmer.Playing eXistenZ and TranscendenZ is about facing your essence, face your subconscious while its creating a virtual reality you'll have to overcome in unexpected ways to win the game (by playing the game, the girl playing Allegra, the 'reality demonstrator' turns into Allegra, a 'virtuality goddess').What game would Heidegger have played to feel his abstract da-sein term ?
satanu22ou	validation	Elmer Bernstein	This is a beautiful color adventure film, with unusually strong costumes, acting, lighting, art direction sets and music by ███████████████.
satanu22ou	validation	Paul Wendkos	This is ████████████' masterpiece.
satanu22ou	validation	Lara Parker	This is one of those times where we see where Jim got his smarts.This episode also features an appearance by hottie ███████████, who played Angelique in the Dark Shadows series and went on to play Laura Banner, Bruce's wife in the Incredible Hulk series a few years later.
satanu22ou	validation	Paul Williams	This wonderful movie captures so many elements of what makes a family comedy funny, entertaining, sweet and memorable, it's difficult to decide where to start.From the opening number, Rainbow Connection, █████████████'s excellent score sung with gusto by Kermit D. Frog, which gives us a prologue of what the whole adventure is about, throughout the story, this is one fun movie.Essentially, it's a road trip movie, where Kermit travels cross-country with a dream of pursuing a rich and famous contract to entertain.
satanu22ou	validation	Anne Bancroft	Victor Mature, as a barely civilized and mostly out of control mountain man and trapper, may be on the poster, but Robert Preston as a failed Union colonel who led his men to get cut to ribbons by Confederate artillery at Shiloh, and is sent to a fort in Oregon for his incompetence, has the most interesting part, married to a young and hard to recognize at first █████████████.
satanu22ou	validation	Erika Kohut	We meet ███████████ (wonderful Isabelle Huppert), a piano teacher, and get introduced to her world.
satanu22ou	validation	Will Smith	Wesley Snipes is born to play this role, although some would've probably pererred Dezenel Washington or ██████████ (lol).
satanu22ou	validation	Lola Albright	When █████████████ as her sister commits suicide over the whole affair, Evelyn's on a mission, get Korvin or die trying.
satanu22ou	validation	Grace Pat Adam	With all the food available in the swamp and rivers that he inhabited the crocodile was only after the quartet, ██████████████ & Jimmy, for invading his watery domain that he felt was the grand ruler of.
satanu22ou	validation	Tommy Lee Jones	Without ███████████████ reprising his role as Woodrow Call or Anjelica Huston as Clara, I figured it just wouldn't seem authentic enough.
satanu22ou	validation	Tarantinos	You thought that ██████████ shot in Kill Bill vol.
JUmaMaheshwarReddy	training	Rubin Carter	This movie looks like it was made for TV  For years I waited for some movie to be made about ████████████, because I loved to see him box at the old MSG
JUmaMaheshwarReddy	training	Robin Williams	Even ██████████████ was so disappointing that I may never see another film he is in Not a single relationship in the story went beyond parlor talk I did like the tazer scene Too bad it didn't shock some meat into the senselessness of the plot Someone needs to tazer the writer and director of this film!
JUmaMaheshwarReddy	training	Keenan Ivory Wayans	The script for "Scary Movie 2" just wasn't ready to go This is a problem with the film that is blatantly evident, to the actors and the audience alike Director ███████████████████, and many of the actors are funny people;
JUmaMaheshwarReddy	training	Michael Callan	██████████████ plays a smarmy photographer who seems, nonetheless, to be regarded as a perfect "catch" by any woman that runs across him;
JUmaMaheshwarReddy	training	Joseph Green's	The film shows clearly why Director ██████████████ career as such and also as a writer never materialized; 
JUmaMaheshwarReddy	training	Quintana	I gave it a 2 just because Natassia Malthe (as the vampiress ████████) looks sooooo sexy in this movie. 
JUmaMaheshwarReddy	training	Greg	I'll keep this short; thanks to ████ for helping me to put this succinctly:
JUmaMaheshwarReddy	training	Julian Sands	I love ████████████ and will at least attempt to watch anything he's in, but this movie nearly did me in I'm hard pressed to remember when I found any other movie to move....so......slow.........ly.....zzzzzzzzzzzz 
JUmaMaheshwarReddy	training	Alexandra	My 10-year-old daughter, █████████, writes: I thought it was very boring, and I thought it was just a repeat of stuff from "101 Dalmatians."
JUmaMaheshwarReddy	training	Donald	I'd love to hear just one person get up and say "██████ I quit and take some of your money and buy a decent hairdo"
JUmaMaheshwarReddy	training	Peter Lorre	After eight Moto films the series had run its course, as this last entry demonstrates ███████████ was clearly weary of trying to pump some sort of human interest and entertainment value into the wispy character of Moto, and the dreadful idea of pairing him with a "funny" British sidekick utterly defeats all his efforts here.
JUmaMaheshwarReddy	training	tommy lee jones	yech, i like ███████████████ and will smith as actors, they have both done some good films, but i wish they hadn't added this one to their resume's To be honest, the book is better..
JUmaMaheshwarReddy	training	Nicolas Cage	I watched this movie because I like ████████████ and well, I found it strange and completely pointless..
JUmaMaheshwarReddy	training	Michael Madsen	I too had to fast forward through most of this movie ██████████████ must have done this movie as a favor to someone.
JUmaMaheshwarReddy	training	Angela Bassett'	The beautiful ██████████████ played Biggie's mother The real one in life looks like a dog.
JUmaMaheshwarReddy	training	Tommy Boy	I rented this movie for a few laughs I had never seen the SNL skit, but with hits like █████████, and Waynes World, it couldn't have been that bad, could it?
JUmaMaheshwarReddy	training	Venessa Redgrave	With a cast list like this one, I expected far better ████████████████ spent the majority of the movie lying in bed The best actresses in the world cannot make anything very interesting when their acting is limited to lying down and falling asleep throughout the entire movie
JUmaMaheshwarReddy	training	Steve	I would love to have that two hours of my life back It seemed to be several clips from █████'s Animal Planet series that was spliced into a loosely constructed script Don't Go, If you must see it, wait for the video ...
JUmaMaheshwarReddy	training	Ajay	i thought this movie will be greatest hit of the year but this film will be the greatest flop of the year,sure nobody did justice to their work, including ████ devagan this film don't deserve any audiences i bet that this film will flop  "FINALLY THIS MOVIE SUCKS"
JUmaMaheshwarReddy	training	Lorna Doone	I first read "███████████" about 20 years ago and absolutely loved it!
JUmaMaheshwarReddy	training	Peter Sellers	I actually saw this movie in the theater back in it's original release It was painful to watch █████████████ embarrass himself so badly The story was incredibly lame and difficult to follow
JUmaMaheshwarReddy	training	Yaphet Kotto	By far the worst movie of all time Even ████████████ could not save this turkey 
JUmaMaheshwarReddy	training	Malcom McDowall	This movie is absolutely pointless, one of the good esamples how ███████████████ never got one decent role after Clockwork Orange This one may be one of the worst though No story, 
JUmaMaheshwarReddy	training	Dutta	I saw this movie with some Indian friends on Christmas Day The quick summary of this movie is MUST AVOID JP █████ wrote, directed, produced and edited this movie and did none of these jobs well. 
JUmaMaheshwarReddy	training	Ben Mezrich	Still 4 out of 10 since it was hard to stop watching because of the great basic plot by ███████████.
JUmaMaheshwarReddy	training	Andy McNabb	This movie is just another average action flick, but it could have been so much better When the guns come out they really needed some choreography help Someone like ███████████ 
JUmaMaheshwarReddy	training	Rosanna Arquette	Kind of drawn in by the erotic scenes, only to realize this was one of the most amateurish and unbelievable bits of film I've ever seen Sort of like a high school film project What was ████████████████ thinking?? 
JUmaMaheshwarReddy	training	David Bowie	Oh I know, third rate songs that sound like they were made up on the spot ███████████ crones the film title over and over a few times and that is the highlight 
JUmaMaheshwarReddy	training	Caridad	I liked the scene with ███████'s mother phone call and the discussion about the contract with all the musicians and the Spanish people.
JUmaMaheshwarReddy	training	Victor Garber	The lead actor (█████████████) seemed so uncomfortable, almost embarrassed in his role -- perhaps he realized how bad the writing was!! 
JUmaMaheshwarReddy	training	Sherriff Roscoe	I bought this (it was only $3, ok?) under the title "Grey Matter" The novelty of seeing ███████████████ in a non-DukesOfHazzard role intrigued me As the other reviewers warned, it's a pretty boring tale of a top secret government experiment gone awry. 
JUmaMaheshwarReddy	training	Jack Jones	There is officially a worse movie than your hateful series out there I won this movie in a contest at college, and it was a waste of money even if it was free ██████████ stars as a truly awful singer whose trying to find some murderers or something 
JUmaMaheshwarReddy	training	Bruce Davidson	This movie is literally about 10 minutes of plot stretched into 100 The only redeeming quality is ██████████████ as the father, but that's not nearly enough to save this stinker A 1 out of 10.
JUmaMaheshwarReddy	training	Regina Lund	███████████ is the only half descent actor, but she disappears in a flood of laughable pronunciations and unbelievable reactions It leaves you horrified that someone actually spent time and money on something like this...
JUmaMaheshwarReddy	training	Ellen Page	The back of the DVD box says ██████████ co-stars in this movie She does not even appear until two thirds of the movie is over and then its in minor role I don't consider it a supporting role 
JUmaMaheshwarReddy	training	Olsen	I think now that the █████ twins are getting older they should try and make the plot less predictable and less like re-runs of 'Full House' If you plan on seeing this film, don't Watch 
JUmaMaheshwarReddy	training	Miike	This is where █████ fails in Visitor Q Extremism becomes mild when it becomes a choose your own adventure.
JUmaMaheshwarReddy	training	Paul Verhoeven's	You'd better choose ████████████████ even if you have watched it
JUmaMaheshwarReddy	training	Stanley Tucci	Very poor effort that offers pretty much nothing to anyone but a hardcore fan of █████████████, who tries, but can not save the poor structure, dialogue, direction, or talent of our leading man. 
JUmaMaheshwarReddy	training	Nikki Berwick God	The only positive thing about this movie (in my opinion) is █████████████████, she looks nice in this movie. 
JUmaMaheshwarReddy	training	Cody	The alien creature was unreal And the fight scenes mild compared to a school yard fight And to make it worse the guy named ████ had an uncontrollable loose filthy tongue which distracts attention from the main film. 
JUmaMaheshwarReddy	training	John Waters	Phew--I don't what to say This is a film that could be really good a with a bunch of stoned viewers Some of the acting reminded me of ████████████ early offerings Perhaps I should take that back--I don't want to insult Waters' ability as a director/storyteller. 
JUmaMaheshwarReddy	training	Grisham	I think I've seen all of the ███████ movies now and generally they're all very poor, except for The Rainmaker, but this one is so bad it's unbelievable WARNING SPOILERISH 
JUmaMaheshwarReddy	training	Henry Silva	Belmondo is a tough cop He goes after a big-time drug dealer (played by ███████████, normally a great villain - see "Sharky's Machine"; but here he is clearly dubbed, and because of that he lacks his usual charisma) 
JUmaMaheshwarReddy	training	JonBenet Ramsey's	In an effort to try to hype up their broadcast, they decided to post actual photos of █████████████████ body in their teasers last night ...saying "Pictures from the case you have never seen before" The two photos were graphic 
JUmaMaheshwarReddy	training	Carlos Mencia	█████████████ continually, violently, hatefully screaming "B**ch!" at women is like screaming "N**ger!" 
JUmaMaheshwarReddy	training	Brenda Blethyn	There ARE funny moments and ██████████████ is fun to watch in the lead role But the ending really ruined a "cute" movie with insultingly-bad messages that only the ultra-liberals of the film world would like to see happen. 
JUmaMaheshwarReddy	training	Brendan Fraser`s	This is a total waste of money The production is poor, the special effects are terrible In my country they had the courage to put this film on video named as "The Mummy" because of the success of ████████████████ film I`m sure that you can find better horror movies.
JUmaMaheshwarReddy	training	Jackie Brown	take ████████████, for example- but they're all so terribly shallow in this, but that is obviously thrown in for entertainment 
JUmaMaheshwarReddy	training	Nicholas Cage	I rate it a 2 simply because there were a few brief moments of promise, but the finish leaves you completely flat █████████████ did as good a job as can be expected in the role, but he had very little to work with
JUmaMaheshwarReddy	validation	Adolf	One last thing: What kind of PLAYMOBIL castle was this at the final sequence? For me this was a kind of "█████'s Adventures in Wonderland
JUmaMaheshwarReddy	validation	Bruce Willis	Although a film with ████████████ is always worth watching, you better skip this one I watched this one on television, so I didn't have to plunk down cash for it Lucky me. 
JUmaMaheshwarReddy	validation	Mike Meyers	What a waste! This movie could have really been something decent, but the writing, in particular, is crap, and the main characters are rather shallow and uninteresting ███████████ was good
JUmaMaheshwarReddy	validation	Ben Affleck	This shouted to me that this film is not very good  Not to my surprise, the film was dire ███████████ plays a guy who buys a family for Christmas 
JUmaMaheshwarReddy	validation	Chris Shadley	.. sorry to say but a 1 in vote.. thats what it it deserve, i would think that █████████████ could come up with a better end.. but maybe next time : ) 
JUmaMaheshwarReddy	validation	George Romero's	Before the release of ███████████████ genre-defining Night of the Living Dead, zombies were relatively well-behaved creatures 
JUmaMaheshwarReddy	validation	Taz	Cheetor- Seriously, they need to have censor bars on this guy How come he dosen't creep out the viewers having the same voice as baby ███? 
JUmaMaheshwarReddy	validation	Gellar	Actually, it was so bad that both of us cracked up laughing at how bad it was I see no future for Miss ██████ in the movies, and suggest that she sticks to television in the future 
JUmaMaheshwarReddy	validation	Richard Condon	From the pen of ██████████████ (The Manchurian Candidate 1962) comes this muddled tale of political intrigue and assassination 
JUmaMaheshwarReddy	validation	Patterson	Another wonderful █████████ book made into an incredibly awful movie If the big budget movies don't work then why make a low budget made for t.v movie that's 10 times worse! 
JUmaMaheshwarReddy	validation	Kusturica	Foreign humor is awful in films (except █████████), stick with doing dramas! 
JUmaMaheshwarReddy	validation	Sean Connery	Though the film features the magnificent ████████████, even he does not measure up to his usual standard, and often just seems to be walking through the paces.
JUmaMaheshwarReddy	validation	Melville	I do agree that though this story by ████████ just might be unfilmable, this isn't even a credible try To move the story into the 20th century just outrages the original story's intent and nature; 
JUmaMaheshwarReddy	validation	chris kattan	████████████ will never get a good comedy role after this and "a night at the roxbury." 
JUmaMaheshwarReddy	validation	Angelina Jolie's	I was surprised with a pretty decent movie ████████████████ unique acting capabilities (or should I say lack thereof?) make her perfect as an android, and the other actors, while terribly average, are at least not terrible.
JUmaMaheshwarReddy	validation	William Shakespeare's	I found it real shocking at first to see █████████████████████ love masterpiece reworked into a gory, violent and kinky sensual movie adaptation
JUmaMaheshwarReddy	validation	Jeffrey Combs	Is there any question that █████████████ is one of the true horror greats?
JUmaMaheshwarReddy	validation	Stephen Chow	It is one of the best of ████████████ I give it a nine out of ten.
JUmaMaheshwarReddy	validation	Sean Bury	Oh, and █████████.. nice to see you make an appearance on the comments here
JUmaMaheshwarReddy	validation	George	It seems that ever time He turned around something happened to him, all good, and I believe it scared ██████ a bit
JUmaMaheshwarReddy	validation	Harald Zwart	I am a huge fan of ████████████, and I just knew that I had to see this movie
JUmaMaheshwarReddy	validation	Amanda Bynes	This movie is a great movie, however it is, as most movie highly predictable The greatest highlight of the movie of course is the star character ████████████
JUmaMaheshwarReddy	validation	Sandra Bullock	I want to say that I like this movie very much! ██████████████ is my favourite actress I like the whole story
JUmaMaheshwarReddy	validation	Alan Rickman	This is one of my all time favorite movies, it's great to watch in groups, I find It's also great for any ████████████ fan, he does such a wonderful job
JUmaMaheshwarReddy	validation	Mrs Kogan	Thank you high school art teacher █████████ for showing us this over and over
JUmaMaheshwarReddy	validation	Elaine	Sally and ██████ really put their hearts into their roles and brought out so much of the characters I fell in love with the story and the women all over again.
JUmaMaheshwarReddy	validation	Brenda Vaccaro	██████████████, as usual was a pleasure to watch, she did a great job with her character
JUmaMaheshwarReddy	validation	Julie Andrews	█████████████ gives a mesmerizing performance at the beginning and end of this film with the "Whistling in the Dark" production number
JUmaMaheshwarReddy	validation	Peter Dalle	...and this movie easily exceeded my expectations The fact that it is written and directed by ███████████ led me to believe it was in style with other films
JUmaMaheshwarReddy	validation	Ali	Very intelligent language usage of ███, which you musn't miss!
JUmaMaheshwarReddy	testing	Barbara Payton	It contains good work by all the character actors and even ██████████████ turns in a credible performance.
JUmaMaheshwarReddy	testing	Park Chan-Wook	I won't bore you with any synopsis, chances are you already know them And hopefully you are already familiar with ██████████████'s work.
JUmaMaheshwarReddy	testing	Luigi Bazzoni	I was very impressed with with this film which was directed by (█████████████)
JUmaMaheshwarReddy	testing	Joe	Starting with a "My Name is ███" like scene in Alcoholics Anonymous tBM careers into a mad spiral of infidelity, double standards and clandestine affairs but what do you expect from a family of lawyers?
JUmaMaheshwarReddy	testing	Sabrina	I saw this last night in Fort Lauderdale In general it was funny and I liked the characters especially ███████
JUmaMaheshwarReddy	testing	Hauer	I recently had the pleasure of meeting Mr █████ at the 2005 Sarasota Film Festival
JUmaMaheshwarReddy	testing	Mika Waltari's	Based on ██████████████ Book,This Second CinemaScope movie ever made is full of rich color,beautiful music and panoramic spectacle.
JUmaMaheshwarReddy	testing	Traffik	I still think ███████ is brilliant and much better than the US film that was based on this drama.
JUmaMaheshwarReddy	testing	John Leguizamo's	████████████████ "Freak" is one of the funniest one-man shows I've ever seen!
JUmaMaheshwarReddy	testing	Charlie	Goof: Factual error When ███████ walks out of the room to commit suicide he takes his gun with a silencer After a few seconds we hear a loud bang from the same gun being fired.
nathanscain	training	Alison Elliott	The writer came up with a pretty decent idea for a story, but many flaws in the execution of the plot took so much away from the film as to nearly render it unwatchable. Basic elements such as character development were glossed over, at best. Inconsistencies also reared their ugly heads. A massive mansion in the middle of the rural Irish countryside? Characters just "showing up" in the gardens during a stormy night (at very convenient times, I might add)? All in all it wasn't "bad". I rated it a 4, based mostly on the story and talent of ██████████████.
nathanscain	training	Vincent D'Onofrio	Despite all it's trappings of style and cinematic invention, this is basically another serial killer thriller, following the same sort of plotline favoured by such old favourites as Silence of the Lambs ? team of cops follows the trail of (particularly nasty) murders, someone else gets taken and they somehow have to find out where they are before it's too late. Only in this case, the only person who knows, the killer himself (powerfully played by █████████████████) is in a coma and we need psychologist Jennifer Lopez' sci-fi mind-meld machine to get into his head and force him to tell all. This is where the film gets all new and different, as we enter (via a 21st-Century CGI update of Dr Who's kaleidoscopic favourite, the trendy time tunnel) a kind of Hellraiser-y weird world of scary crazy stuff going on all over the place, ruled over by D'Onofrio, now a kind of superking overlord of his twisted mental world, inside his comatose body.

nathanscain	training	Andrew Davis	seriously i loved this film..i had started to read the book and i loved it...the way everything was set up and everything had a purpose...i think this film did so well was because Louis Sachar wrote the screenplay..and of course ████████████ directed it...Shia Lebouf gives a great performance for his first film...the storyline is very cool and interesting...there's humor, heart and intensity...it is very similar to the book..i find this film to be not the least bit boring...i absolutely loved it...and i encourage anyone to read the book..all in all this film is very well put together and carefully crafted...two thumbs up for me in every single way

nathanscain	training	Chris Gunn	"Tracks" is supposed to be about young teenagers 14 to 16 years of age being tried as adults and placed in an adult jail. ██████████ just doesn't look the part. He is too old, and this deprives the film of any impact. America has a reputation of being cruel towards juveniles. There is the possibility of a story along these lines, but the film doesn't manage to come across. There is a sexual harassment scene, and a couple of fights - almost compulsory stereotypes in this sort of story. But it is boring, boring, boring. The 'David and Goliath' factor, where a young and fragile hero goes up against a powerful brute villain is missing completely. There must be many young teenage actors who could do the part successfully. "Salems Lot" and "Dune" had the same problem. When will producers learn?
nathanscain	training	Jason Connery	Excellent performance. There still are good actors around! Also great directing and photography. Very true to Shakespear, and a 'must' for all Shakespear fans. Macbeth (█████████████) moved me to tears with his final monolog (out brief candle, out)He gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face, which makes it the more interesting. Helen Baxendale is a very credible lady Macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl, but deadly in her taste for blood and evil. If you love death and decay, and Shakespears lyrics... this is the one.

nathanscain	training	Christopher Walken	I enjoyed two of the three movies in the "Sarah, Plain & Tall" trilogy. This, the final of the three, was definitely one of the "good ones. " It is an excellent family film with wonderful acting by the three adult stars: ██████████████████, Glenn Close and Jack Palance. The storyline is simple but well-told. The only sub-par performance was by one of the kids. It was interesting to see how the kids had grown since that first movie. Of the three, that initial "Sarah," was the best- filmed with some beautiful cinematography. This movie didn't have that, but it had the best story. It had some genuinely-tearful sentimental moments and a very nice ending. Highly recommended.

nathanscain	training	Gary Kroeger	This movie is absolutely stupid and wonderful at the same time. It's an Airplane-type movie. It does all the silly jokes, visual and verbal. The star, ████████████, slips into a fair John Wayne impersonation throughout the movie. Marc Singer as the German Von Kraut, is fantastic, and does a terrific accent. If you enjoy this type of movie, find it, watch it, and enjoy. It's great.

nathanscain	training	Bill Murray	This was okay, but really a bit disappointing because I expected more laughs. Considering the storyline and the lead actor (███████████), it should have been a lot funnier than it turned out to be. Only part of this made me really laugh, such as when Murray lost control of his semi and was speeding down the road at a weird angle. (You have to see it, to appreciate it.) The supporting cast was anything but likable people. Just look at a sampling of the names: Matthew McConaughey, Janeane Garofalo and Linda Fiorentino. Yecch! McConaughey's role in here as "Tip Tucker" was just downright annoying. He was the worst. Other that those people, the movie had some charming moments but overall it is not recommended.

nathanscain	training	M.J. Fox	Not that I dislike childrens movies, but this was a tearjerker with few redeeming qualities. ████████ was the perfect voice for Stuart and the rest of the talent was wasted. Hugh Laurie can be amazingly funny, but is not given the chance in this movie. It´s sugar-coated sugar and would hardly appeal to anyone over 7 years of age. See Toy Story, Monsters Inc. or Shrek instead. 3/10

nathanscain	training	Mark Wahlberg's	Rock Star is a "nice" movie. Everyone is nice. Even the guys who aren't supposed to be nice, really are nice. Chris is a nice guy, who learns a lesson in life.

nathanscain	training	Jennifer Aniston	Rock Star is a "nice" movie. Everyone is nice. Even the guys who aren't supposed to be nice, really are nice. Chris is a nice guy, who learns a lesson in life.

nathanscain	training	Morgan Freeman	Bruce Almighty is the story of Bruce Nolan, an average man who feels God is messing up his life. God confronts him and show Bruce the error of his ways. Of course, giving someone God's powers could take a turn for the worse. Bruce Almighty is a good comedy, Jim Carrey is good, as always ██████████████ is first-rate and seems right at home as God and the cast brings the plot together well. The jokes are almost always on target, although sometimes they resort a bit too much on Carrey's facial expressions. I liked the fact that the movie actually portrayed God, not only that but also as a black man. I thought this quite well, especially with the brilliant Freeman. There are some hilarious scenes, the opening cookie scene for instance, others miss the target slightly but still a good film. 6/7 out of 10

nathanscain	training	Kristen Bell	I first saw this movie on the Lifetime Television network after hearing some good reviews and seeing previews. The plot follows Gracie(████████████), a 17 year old girl who deals with trying to keep her brothers from being taken away from her and put into foster homes due to her drug-addicted and often absent mother Rowena(Anne Heche). With stunning performances from both Bell and Heche as the daughter and mother duo the film has real edge. With the supporting cast including Diane Ladd, this television movie surpasses the stereotypes of a typical movie-of-the-week. I strongly recommend this movie to anyone who wants to be inspired by a true story set to the screen.

Being made by the producers of Xena is a quality guarantee, and Cleopatra 2525 isn't that different from Xena. The female warriors formula is brought to the future, where they don't have to fight warriors or gods, but dangerous robots which dwell in the surface, and the humans are forced to live underground. Along the two seasons of Cleopatra, they develop an interesting and funny underground world, and we get to know the three main characters: Cleopatra (████████████), Hel (Gina Torres) and Sarge (Victoria Pratt). They all are different, but as a team, they work really well. The three main actresses appeared previously in Xena, like most of the regular/guest cast (there are some known faces from Hercules too, or from both shows). I specially liked the character played by Danielle Cormack (Ephiny in Xena), which is very different from any of her roles I previously knew.

nathanscain	training	James Marsden	Even while trying to recover an extremely poor script with above average actors, this movie is a bomb. What started out as enticing, quickly became boring and relatively unbelievable. █████████████ (X-Men, Sugar and Spice) is a high school student who is forced to transfer to a new school in a small town after living the big city life in Chicago. Shortly after arrival, he learns of a community plot to surgically brain wash all the teens into perfection. After deciding to be the hero, he is overshadowed by a moronic janitor played by William Sadler (Project X, Demon Knight, Shawshank Redemption) who saves the day with an El Camino filled with high pitch whistling rat traps. With numerous plot holes and unexplained story lines, this movie is not much above a quick cure for insomnia.

nathanscain	training	Gruner	And I am now suffering from post traumatic stress syndrome. This movie was horrible. It was boring, unrealistic, and the acting was dreadful. The best part of the movie was the end credits because that signaled the end of my torture. Watching ██████ play the nice guy with moves of death and a heart of gold is wearing out its welcome. If I hear him say," I don't want to fight" one more time I will scream in frustration. He has potential, but he is picking the wrong scripts. There were so many things in this movie I could nitpick, I would be typing for days. The worst would be Gruner blatantly plugging his own line of athletic gear. Then there is the gratuitous nudity, the requisite nosy reporter, and the bad guy wearing black. Skip this or suffer like I did.
nathanscain	training	Jackie Chan	Nothing I dislike more than a kung-fu movie that plays for laughs. It is the main reason I can't stand ███████████ (or his lookalikes). He was not always a clown, I must add. "My Young Auntie" is slapstick martial arts of the worst kind. It is a perfect example of how the subgenre was brought down to the mud by endless silly antics and childish behavior. Unless you are 5-year-old, I really don't understand how anyone could find this kind of film funny. But humor is indeed a very subjective thing. Personally, I think this type of approach did permanent damage to the beloved subgenre. I did think leading lady Kara Hui was very good here. But I had such a hard time sitting through this one that I could not enjoy her fine performance. If you don't mind all the silliness, you might enjoy it. I know I didn't.
nathanscain	training	Billy Crystal	First off, I absolutely loved this movie. As a █████████████ fan, I must say that I was expecting more comedic situations than I actually got. However, it was nice to see him in a role with more depth and emotion. His portrayal of talent agent Sammy was brilliantly performed and uniquely him. In addition, Gheorghe Muresan (as Maximus) was superb in his first film role. When Sammy goes to Romania to visit his client on location he has his world turned upside down. He never expected that he would accidentally find the one person who could change his life. Sammy and Max's journey is unique and moving, and even humorous at times. Plus, the location in Czech Republic where parts of the film were shot, was absolutely beautiful. I have to say, this dramatic comedy had me feeling a variety of emotions. I thought it was excellent and I would recommend it to anyone and everyone.
nathanscain	validation	Richard Rossi	Dreadfully bad, the acting is so poor it draws attention to what is going on in the film, not that it matters. The quality of the film is grainy and at times blurry. Diodn't anyone making the film know how to focus the camera?!It is very amateurishly done. It is clearly evident director █████████████ has no idea how to make a film. The camera work seems like it was done by a child, the script is laughable bad. This certainly has to rank among the worst film of the 2000's. The lack of effort to capture the time period - the early 1900's is painfully obvious. This would be an excellent example for a film class and how NOT to make a film.

Anyway, this movie is a poor excuse of film making. It tries to be something it is not (mainly funny and aimed at adults). The ending comes out of nowhere and makes Paul Rudd's character seem like the antagonist when it is the wife who jacking up on her vibrator and sleeping with every guy who walks around. Also, is that the only thing this woman has going for her - an orgasm? And sticking a pager inside herself, why is that funny? It was a bad ripoff of Absolutely Fabulous. If this is what passes for adult comedies in Hollywood, no wonder Indie films are getting awards.

nathanscain	validation	Bree Turner's	This film was terrible to be honest. No acting, no story, just a cop-out of the first one. Everyone is commenting on █████████████ portrayal of the "bitch" being great and the best .. it's not actually? I'm from the U.K and maybe shes not a familiar face over here but I cant think of anything else she's been in. She tried too hard to be the "bitch" and gives a mediocre performance? The cheering was o.k in this one, but nothing special. On the back of the D.V.D cover (yes! i didn't know i wouldn't like it!) it says something like "with a group of rising, up-and-coming new stars" .. what stars? They haven't been in anything since. I can ONLY vaguely remember watching Faune Chambers in "Epic Movie" which was also a flop in my eyes? The acting is shocking! I LOVE the Bring It On series and I actually do prefer the straight-to-DVD films rather than the original (my opinion!), i like the first one, and I LOVE bring it on 3 & 4 .. but this one? - - NOT WORTH A PLACE IN MY FAVES.

Maybe I just was looking for something clever and witty. This wasn't it.

This funny, out of character Adam Sandler vehicle was bumpy at best, with a rather insulting Buddhist monk scene and some unintentionally dumb sequences as well as some overly obvious cameos which made the movie campy though tolerably cute. This feel good, though somewhat over the top anger solves anger philosophy ends up with a small twist and a satisfying conclusion. It was nice to see Adam Sandler can act. Both Sandler and Jim Carrey are gaining a lot of respect from me lately. Different, diversionary, insipid in places, but a pleasant romantic comedy. Seven out of ten stars.

This funny, out of character Adam Sandler vehicle was bumpy at best, with a rather insulting Buddhist monk scene and some unintentionally dumb sequences as well as some overly obvious cameos which made the movie campy though tolerably cute. This feel good, though somewhat over the top anger solves anger philosophy ends up with a small twist and a satisfying conclusion. It was nice to see Adam Sandler can act. Both Sandler and ██████████ are gaining a lot of respect from me lately. Different, diversionary, insipid in places, but a pleasant romantic comedy. Seven out of ten stars.
nathanscain	validation	Christopher Walken	"The Funeral" is one of Abel Ferrara's best movies, not to say his best work besides the instant classic "King of New York". The cast is superb, and all the big names (██████████████████, Chris Penn, Isabella Rossellini etc.) give breathtaking performances that you'll never forget. The story is intense and absolutely plausible, one can imagine that it happened right as Ferrara tells it back in the 1930's. The climax will knock you right out of your seats and will leave you gasping for breath. an undeniable masterpiece: undoubtedly 10 out of 10.
nathanscain	validation	Amy Poehler	███████████ is a terrific comedian on Saturday Night Live, but her role in this movie doesn't give her anything to work with. Her character, a publisher's representative guiding a new author on a book tour, is mean, not funny.<br /><br />Susan Sarandon plays the author's mother who is involved with the sadistic gym teacher (Billy Bob Thorton) the author had when he was a chubby junior high student. Unfortunately her role doesn't require a talented actress. The funniest thing is the way she looks in the awful gown she wears as the queen of the corn festival. There is no explanation of why the corn queen is old enough to have a grown son.<br /><br />The plot is the stale one of an author who wrote a best selling self-help book and then adopts behavior that contradicts his advice.<br /><br />Still, it is not the worst movie I've ever seen, and I didn't erase it before watching it.
nathanscain	validation	Henry Winkler	I saw the film twice in the space of one week, both times the at a cinema in Orpington, Kent, UK. The place was packed both times and people had to be turned away. From the start of the film with █████████████ getting 'injured' on the football field the whole audience was in uproar with laughter, laughter that lasted until the credits.<br /><br />For those who love American wrestling this film is a must, but be ready to see Henry Winkler as you have never seen him before. Also look out for a very well known actor whose trademark wrestling move is a head-but!<br /><br />If you get a chance watch this movie and it is family comedy entertainment at its best!
nathanscain	validation	Keira Knightley	I saw the movie because I'm a ███████████████ fan and in that respect it was good, she brings a great performance as usual. Really there is nothing that I can say is bad about the acting or the movie in general other than it isn't my favorite kind of movie. In a phrase "it was messed up". If you like thrillers and mysteries then this is your kind of movie. It may seem a bit predictable at times, but it is well written and gives some unexpected turns. The movie takes place in a past tense with flashes of memory as everyone tries to figure out what happened, including the audience. If you ever get the chance to watch this movie it won't disappoint you, its a good way to pass the time. But if you don't ever watch it, you aren't missing much.
nathanscain	validation	Bridget Fonda	I liked the quiet noir of the first part, the acting of Pacino and Cusak, especially their scenes together. The moodiness of the setting and the juxtaposition of the old pol and the idealistic youth was effecting. I wish █████████████ had more scenes in the movie; she was an earnest and appealing character. The film went off the rails for me when the assistant mayor starting snooping around the mafioso to get to the bottom of something his boss clearly didn't want him meddling in. Nobody in their right mind would meet a mafioso on an abandoned dock in a junkyard. Here the story became implausible. Something that I don't understand: why did the cop and Vito have a shootout if the latter was delivering info that could bring down the corrupt judge?
nathanscain	validation	Robert Morse	Doris Day never lets a bad script get her down. Even in the most trying of circumstances, Day gives 100% and usually comes out unscathed. This comedy, perhaps inspired by a real-life New York City black-out in 1965 but actually adapted from a late-'50s French play by Claude Magnier, gives Doris little to do but spoof her own goody-goody image and, in the second-half, be comically sedated (which is amusing because of the spin Day gives to the situation). There are some funny lines here, yet the staginess of the material has obviously been carried over from the play...and instead of conjuring up some amusing incidents within the Big Apple, we get stuck in the suburbs. Doris' co-stars (Patrick O'Neal, ████████████, and Terry-Thomas) are not well-suited to her, and neither is the shapeless hairdo they've got her wearing. Still, it's not terrible, it features a few big laughs, and for Day-buffs it's a must-see. ** from ****
nathanscain	validation	Errol Flynn	Daffy the actor is in the boss' office, pleading for a new role and a new image. He's tired of being typecast as a comic. He brings a script for a film he wants to do: The Scarlet Pumpernickel by Daffy Dumas Duck. He starts reading it and we see the images as the story unfolds.<br /><br />"Once upon a time," Daffy starts...and then stops to say, "Great opening, huh?" Anyway, "in merry old England......."<br /><br />We get the story with Daffy as the hero, and Porky Pig and Sylvester the Cat playing key roles. The colors and the art in depicting the castles, streets and costumes of the day are spectacular. The story is good; not a ton of laughs but smart enough with inside jokes (███████████ references, Jewish jokes and lines) to be enjoyable for us adults. Daffy Duck cartoons, from what I've seen, are geared more for adults than kids, anyway.
nathanscain	testing	Gilbert Gottfried	I had completely forgotten about this late night movie show until I came across a reference to it on another IMDb page. And what a great show it was, with wonderful bottom-of-the-barrel flicks interspersed with the occasional legit movie, and hosted by various funny folks like █████████████████, Such fond memories. The topic of female nudity -- a frequent occurrence in many of the flicks shown -- and how this was handled makes for some very funny reading here, and I remember that sort of thing vividly. Today, the station would simply optically obscure what it doesn't want us to see, instead of making ridiculous and downright damaging edits. Many of these films may never be seen again, sad to say. I agree with those who suggest watching G4, which runs some pretty awful and hilarious flicks from time to time. But it's not and never will be "USA Up All Night." That was one of a kind.
nathanscain	testing	Adam Sandler	████████████ plays a hilarious role in this fun comedy. Plot is a little weak, but its covered up by funny scenes every where you look and whenever Adam Sandler is in it, you know it's going to be fun. A must if you love comedy. 80%
nathanscain	testing	Jim Carrey	Bruce Almighty is the story of Bruce Nolan, an average man who feels God is messing up his life. God confronts him and show Bruce the error of his ways. Of course, giving someone God's powers could take a turn for the worse. Bruce Almighty is a good comedy, ██████████ is good, as always Morgan Freeman is first-rate and seems right at home as God and the cast brings the plot together well. The jokes are almost always on target, although sometimes they resort a bit too much on Carrey's facial expressions. I liked the fact that the movie actually portrayed God, not only that but also as a black man. I thought this quite well, especially with the brilliant Freeman. There are some hilarious scenes, the opening cookie scene for instance, others miss the target slightly but still a good film. 6/7 out of 10
nathanscain	testing	John Wayne	I was eight years old when I first saw this movie on the big screen in 1942. It was my first color movie and the scenes with the giant octopus gave me nightmares for a long time after. Today I still enjoy the film for its beautiful color photography, exciting sea scenes and fine performances from Ray Milland and ██████████. Wayne is unjustly accused of causing his ship to sink for profit. The story unfolds as he tries to clear his name .Paulette Goddard provides the love interest. The film never drags,whether on land or at sea where some of the most exciting action takes place.The underwater scenes,especially the finale ,are memorable. Supporting cast, score and special effects are all top notch.DeMille directs in his usual showman style. A fine effort from all concerned.
nathanscain	testing	Danny Devito	THE VAN is a simple teensploitation picture made especially for the drive in that goes out of it's way to make you feel comfortable, providing many opportunities to laugh and cry with your friends. ████████████ has a small yet plentiful role as the manager of a car wash and almost steals the show! All the leads are well acted, the characters complex and the directing quite competent for this type of picture. A Crown International Release.
nathanscain	testing	Jack Nicholson	Adam Sandler was great and ██████████████ was his usual crazy self. This funny, out of character Adam Sandler vehicle was bumpy at best, with a rather insulting Buddhist monk scene and some unintentionally dumb sequences as well as some overly obvious cameos which made the movie campy though tolerably cute.

Both Sandler and Jim Carrey are gaining a lot of respect from me lately. Different, diversionary, insipid in places, but a pleasant romantic comedy. Seven out of ten stars.
nathanscain	testing	Robert DeNiro	It is hilarious to see █████████████ do spoofs on all his previous Mob characters. To see him crying after all the tough guys he has played it is really funny. Billy Crystal is excellent as his therapist who is trying to help him through his anxiety issues. I want to see it again so I can hear all the lines I missed the first time because I was laughing so hard. Rating 10

nathanscain	testing	Hugh Jackman	I really enjoyed this movie a lot when it first came out 8 long years ago and I decided to revisit it with my little brother tonight and enjoyed it just as much as I did back then. I think it's definitely one of the better Marvel films and up there with the first Spider-Man and Iron Man. I'm definitely glad I decided to check it out again.<br /><br />There are a lot of great elements in this film and I thought the story along with the effects were both great. The acting was really good as well with great performances from James Marsden and ████████████. I thought they did a great job of adapting the comic book into this film as I've been a big fan of the comic books since I was very little kid.<br /><br />Most Marvel fans have most likely seen this film, and a few times over. However, if you haven't yet, you really should do yourself the favor of checking it out. You probably will enjoy it quite a bit.
nathanscain	testing	Guy Ritchie	No doubt, when Madonna and ███████████ married, it was because they both thought it would help their movie careers. If you've been through the ordeal of watching "Swept Away," then you know at that level it was a match made in hell. After nearly 20 years of trying to become a respected actress (or "octress" as she might have pronounced it in "The Next Best Thing"), she still can't get out of herself long enough to turn in a performance that anyone with taste could even call decent. And that's the thing that makes people dislike her so much on the screen: that gut feeling that her ego is so inflated that it prevents her from being able to just let go and connect with her audience. If there's any justice in this universe, she just blew her last chance.
nathanscain	testing	Uma Thurman	One of 2002's best acting performances is in this movie about two young women pursuing their dreams but only finding emptiness. One will never be disappointed by the always great acting of Gena Rowlands and Juliette Lewis. The surprise is in the acting of ███████████. Her character has to be one of the most difficult roles I've ever seen, and she is so convincing that it's hard to believe that she doesn't live a life off-stage as she did here. The movie is excellently directed and edited. The subject is somewhat discomforting, as is much of today's culture.
Kovida98	training	Christopher Walken	If you fast forward through the horrible singing, you will find a classic fairy tale underneath ██████████████████ is very humorous and surprisingly good in the role 
Kovida98	training	Bret Carr	The realism of the movie and it's performance by █████████ is not to be missed The very nature of it's almost interactive effect, will cause people to leave the theater either liberated or questioning their very identity Bravo on the next level of cinema.
Kovida98	training	Roger Livesey	Be prepared to have your heart warmed by this sweet, innocent and charming love story █████████████ acts like a man possessed to steal the show!!!!  British Cinema should cry when it remembers how good it used to be in those early post war years. 
Kovida98	training	Cinderella	This sequel does what Return to Neverland didn't accomplish A good follow-up to the ██████████ story; but what becomes of Drusilla? Another sequel? I hope so!
Kovida98	training	Fartman Maurice	. This liberal attitude is also seen in the hilarious '████████████████ character As his lover says to him: 'Most people are embarrassed about farting You turn it into an art form.'
Kovida98	training	Kate	My wife, ████ and I absolutely loved the series and can't wait for the next one (hopefully there is a sequel!)
Kovida98	training	Phillip	Every time I watch it, the ending makes me cry I can really identify with Busy ███████'s character, and how I would feel if the same thing had happened to me.
Kovida98	training	Sheeta	This movie totally impressed me! I fell in love with Pazu and ██████, and their sweet, caring friendship 
Kovida98	training	Dr Petiot	This is easily a 9 Michel Serrault, known more for comic roles in the earlier part of his acting career, does a stunning, even worryingly stunning job of impersonating █████████, a legendary French serial killer. 
Kovida98	training	Ed Harris	The three main characters are amazing De Niro has done one of his best jobs but █████████ is the star of this movie Possibly,this was his best performance ever.
Kovida98	training	Bill Ivans	In 1967 I visited the Lake Elsinore glider-port and flew a yellow Pratt Read sailplane Returning to Germany the above serious ran on TV and one segment was about the high altitude sailplane flights in California in the early 50ies (The real life pilot was ██████████, I don't know who played him in the series) 
Kovida98	training	Emma Roberts	I thought ████████████ did a superb job and the rest of the cast was just fine My only criticism is that the Los Angeles sets were not as interesting as they should have been 
Kovida98	training	John Adam	Strange things begin to happen in the house, and █████████ begins to turn into the man who disappeared, who was actually a mass murderer Highly recommended 8/10
Kovida98	training	Arnold Ridley	Interestingly the ghost train was written by █████████████ of Dads Army fame (Private Godfrey the medic) Watch it on a rainy Sunday afternoon after your lunch and smile.
Kovida98	training	Abhay	The idea of marrying a stranger through the mutual arrangement of parents is difficult, especially in this modern age Yet this is the case in this Hindi film Told with humor, and fresh perspective, we learn of █████ and Ritika who have only met once and are now on their traditional five day honeymoon 
Kovida98	training	Jeremy Northam	shallow The main character, ██████████████, decides to immerse himself into the world of espionage 
Kovida98	training	Conchatta Ferrell	No one was glamorous or looked as if they had just spent a session with the makeup or costume department █████████████████ is just wonderful She is an example of the strong, persevering people who came to Wyoming in the early 20th century and let no hardship stand in their way of a new life in a new land.
Kovida98	training	Eric Williams	The Wooden Horse was one of the first "great" escape stories from World War II, telling the true story of █████████████ and others in their escape from Stalag-Lufft III in October of 1943 
Kovida98	training	George Clooney	Nice to see ██████████████ doing something genuinely funny for a change The casting is perfect and the acting standards very high
Kovida98	training	Jenna Jameson	Oh yeah! █████████████ did it again! Yeah Baby! This movie rocks It was one of the 1st movies i saw of her 
Kovida98	training	Al Pacino	A lot of people are saying that █████████ over acted but I mean common obviously for a movie role like this -- a cuban drug lord you need a bit of over acting in this role with that cuban accent 
Kovida98	training	John Hughes	We may count ourselves lucky that writers/directors like ███████████ are occasionally able to make their creative voices heard. 
Kovida98	training	Angelina Jolie	Stupid, Stupid, Stupid I think that ██████████████ is probably one of the most talented actress' today, but a movie like this isn't just worth her time 
Kovida98	training	Paltrow	This made me laugh out loud a lot, with perfect British and verbal material Every acting performance is spot-on, and ███████ completely nails the role of a kind matchmaker 
Kovida98	training	John Lithgow	This movie is really nerve racking Cliffhangin movie!Stallone was good as always!Michael Rooker put on a surprising performance and ████████████ play a excellent villain!
Kovida98	training	Brad Pitt	I strongly recommend anyone that has the chance to go to Montana to fish or be outdoors to do so It is amazing I can not think of anyone else that could play the role better than █████████ 
Kovida98	training	Brendan Frazer	There are hundreds of zombies, and the Director looks like ██████████████ (he has a cameo) and it is just a wild trip.
Kovida98	training	TOM BOSLEY	This unique blend makes for a unique and compelling story The casts is outstanding, including ██████████ who as far as I know never has been in a horror movie before
Kovida98	training	Martin Luther King	A system who hides the truth, and who is violating the rights of existence A boy who, inspired by ██████████████████, stands up, and tells the truth A family who is falling apart, and fighting against it 
Kovida98	training	Laurence Olivier	This was by far the best war documentary ever made From the very beginning of the first episode when Sir ████████████████ described the horrific events in Oradour-Sur-Glane 'The day the soldiers came' To the final days of the war when the mushroom clouds appeared over Japan
Kovida98	training	Ivan Trojan	The actors are excellent, especially ███████████, whose final scenes are a real master piece! I highly recommend this film, it's one of the most original ones I've ever seen!
Kovida98	training	Verhoeven	viewers However, it'll be hard even for them not to appreciate the several imaginative sequences this film contains, or to ignore Krabbe's first-rate performance █████████ maintains an intriguing ambivalence throughout the film
Kovida98	training	Jay Chou	you're so obsessed by the films of Hollywood that you can't see how good is this movie i'm not a fan of ████████ but i like his play 
Kovida98	training	Sadie	perfection It is sad to see how █████'s father refused to allow his daughter to continue to see her boyfriend due to a possible misunderstanding 
Kovida98	training	Chris Sarandon	Her boyfriend (a slimy lawyer, played by ██████████████) starts poking around and finds that things are not what they seem, not by a long shot 
Kovida98	training	Ashley Judd	A small, simple movie that is very entertaining and leaves you with the feeling that you didn't just waste an hour and a half of your life. ███████████ is really quite amazing in this movie I had never really been a fan or had noticed her before but going back and seeing this early performance of hers convinced me she's extremely talented. 
Kovida98	training	Tony	I disagree but this movie is very very good ████ is a bad ass guy and knows that he's intimidating and uses it to get ahead 
Kovida98	training	Teresa Pavlinek	███████████████ was a popular member of the Toronto Second City cast She has done numerous guest spots and commercials up here in Canada 
Kovida98	training	Wu Ma	The film has some wonderful visuals and amazing fights.I love especially the fight scene between █████ and the tree demon tongue.
Kovida98	training	Bryan Adams	Well, what can I say, this movie really got to me, it's not so bad, as many say, I really loved it, although the idea seems so simple, and rather boring, it isn't First of all I enjoyed the soundtrack (███████████), it really goes with the movie Second the simple story
Kovida98	training	Stacy Peralta	This was the best documentary I've ever seen!! I just saw Lords of Dogtown and wanted to know more about █████████████, and was surprised and happy to find out this was one of his films as well Great Job Stacy!
Kovida98	training	'Smita Patil'	The most definitive movie on Mumbai Police This movie has stood the test of times. Om Puri gives a stellar performance, ███████████ no less All the actors have done their best and the movie races on thrilling you at every moment
Kovida98	training	Ruth Gordon	A top notch Columbo from beginning to end I particularly like the interaction between Columbo and the killer, ███████████. 
Kovida98	training	Robert Drivas	There's a lot of spliced-in, second-long snippets of Vegas traffic, casino crowds, and even a scene where the █████████████ character is having a conversation with his father about how much he's grown up
Kovida98	training	Judd Nelson	I also thought that the cast in this movie was great, ███████████ is always the best! I also enjoyed the plot as a whole 
Kovida98	training	Ashley Judd	This is an intimate movie of a sincere girl in the real world out of Hollywood's cheap fantasy is a very good piece of its class, and ███████████ fills the role impeccably It may appear slow for thrill seekers though Cool movie for a calm night.
Kovida98	training	Jafar Panahi	The director ████████████, from "The White Balloon", "The Mirror" and "The Circle", shot this movie on the day that Iran defeated Bahrain and qualified to the World Cup in Germany 
Kovida98	training	Albert	It's actually far better than that, and I found myself really enjoying it I don't know too much about Queen Victoria beyond what most know - married to ██████, who died young, and she mourned him ever after Seeing the circumstances 
Kovida98	training	Marta Belenguer	Also pay attention to the performance of ███████████████, her reaction shots are incredible. Overall rating: 8/10
Kovida98	training	Busby Berkley	Such energy and vitality You just can't go wrong with █████████████ films and this certainly must be his best Of course the choreography is wonderful, but also the banter between Cagney and Blondell is so colorful and such a delight Don't miss this one.
Kovida98	validation	Ben Stiller	The cast of this movie plays their characters to the 'T' (If you watched Permanent Midnight and became a ███████████ fan then yes you will be disappointed) 
Kovida98	validation	David Beckham	 I am one of those American fools that has no clue I had never even seen █████████████ before this film I chose to ignore the buzz surrounding this film at the time it was released in America Enough about me  
Kovida98	validation	Walerian Borowczyk	In the serious terms now,its an allegory, that men sometimes could be bestial, visceral and brutal,██████████████████ (the director) shows us the loss of innocence, sexual violence, rape and brutality
Kovida98	validation	Jeremy Clarkson	I have to say that sometimes "looks" are all that matters, just like ███████████████ from BBC has pointed out (not about our earth though, but he is right anyway). 
Kovida98	validation	Ricky Ullman	I thought that Avi did a great job in his role and ████████████ was absolutely true to his role for a Disney actor 
Kovida98	validation	Jim Carey	The movie is a great combination of comedy and typical romance █████████ is superb as a down on his luck reporter who is given the power to change himself and the city in which he resides 
Kovida98	validation	Jim Larson's	 ████████████ comments about it being a "sweet funny story of 2 people crossing paths" were dead on Writers probably shouldn't get a bonus, everyone else SRO for making the movie. 
Kovida98	validation	Cary Grant	Filled with great characters all of whom, ██████████ is convinced, are out to fleece him in the building of a dream home. 
Kovida98	validation	Michael Redgrave	The narration by Sir ████████████████ is moving The length of the work makes it easily accessible for class room exposure or TV/Video time slots.
Kovida98	validation	Gena Rowland	Beautiful film, pure Cassavetes style ████████████ gives a stunning performance of a declining actress, dealing with success, aging, loneliness...and alcoholism 
Kovida98	validation	madhur	The first review I saw of Page 3 said "what is ██████ bhandarkar finally wants to say?" Should he say something so decisive. 
Kovida98	validation	Eddie	Until I saw this special on HBO, I had never heard of █████ Izzard I sure am glad that I have now! He is one of the funniest comedians I have ever seen! 
Kovida98	validation	Meryl Streep	This movie is very good The screenplay is enchanting But ████████████ is most impressive
Kovida98	validation	Michelle Rodriguez	This movie has made me want to become a director, and ██████████████████ is brilliant How the hell wasn't she on mtv's top 25 under 25
Kovida98	validation	Kurt Russel	And you know what it worked ███████████ did what I though was a remarkable role in showing the emotionless soldier that he was I recommend this movie 
Kovida98	validation	Jud Nelson	██████████ is an aspiring actor who becomes involved with a married couple who enjoy playing sadistic games on other people 
Kovida98	validation	Dean Koontz	I still find it hard to believe that a fine - if overlong - novel by ███████████ was transformed into this utter excrement. 
Kovida98	validation	Raquel Welch	I do find a bit of interest in an Italian spoof of movies like One Million Years B.C with ████████████ I'll give When Women Had Tails a point for its historic "value" 
Kovida98	validation	Charlotte Arnold's	I hate ██████████████████ guts, and I just want to punch her in the face or stab her with a knife every time
Kovida98	validation	Abel Ferrara	On the Christmas Eve, while buying the Christmas gift for their daughter, the father is kidnapped, and his wife desperately tries to raise a high amount of money to pay the requested ransom "R Xmas" is a deceptive movie of ████████████ 
Kovida98	validation	William H Macy	Jews That said, the problem with this movie is that it views the United States - probably the most welcoming society ever to Jews outside of Israel - as a not very different place from Nazi Germany Set in 1943, the movie is about a man (██████████████) who gets confused with a Jew after he starts wearing glasses! 
Kovida98	validation	Robert Carlylse	This film was just on two nights running on ITV1. dear oh dear Someone actually bought this on the strength of ███████████████. 
Kovida98	validation	Dragon Hunt	Why is it that Canada can turn out decent to good movies in every genre, other then action? I caught ███████████ on TV the other day and it was like a train wreck I just could not change the channel
Kovida98	validation	Halfdan Hussey's	The one somewhat redeeming aspect of the movie is ████████████████ innovative visual effects However, as eye-catching as they may be, they do little to make up for the gaping flaws mentioned above 
Kovida98	validation	Paxton	An example of the acting is when ██████'s character, Vann, is upset the South Vietnamese colonel for so he throws some of the sand from the "sand map"
Kovida98	validation	Abel Ferrara's	For the people who love ██████████████ films such as The Funeral, 'R Xmas is going to be a big disappointment, as it's been for me 
Kovida98	validation	Don Peake	However it does have a few moments of interest to slasher fans, the occasional touch of spooky atmosphere, and a decent music score by █████████ Still, it's business as usual for dead-camper movies.
Kovida98	validation	CJ Stacy	Actually ████████ was the only good part of this movie - her charisma shines like a diamond in this horrid dung pile 
Kovida98	validation	Tom Selleck's	I kind of had somewhat high expectations for this movie I've always thought that █████████████ lesser known movies (ie Runaway and Coma), where well above the ones he had more press 
Kovida98	validation	Dunk Ernest	And again, I find myself in the minority. I didn't like this one This is the ONLY Varney work I haven't embraced, including Knowhutimean Slam ███████████ rates the credit for being the worst of the line, but this is a clear competitor for that dubious title. 
Kovida98	testing	Lon Chaney Jr	At least █████████████ is still in it He once more reprises the role of the mummy Kharis, for the third time Too bad that he has such limited screen time this time 
Kovida98	testing	jack	The end result is they get a flat tire The driver gets one of the people on the shuttle to help change the tire and the ████ slips and the guys fingers are crushed between the tire and the shuttle It's at this point that the driver reveals himself to be a kidnapper and he has taken all the people hostage  
Kovida98	testing	David Lynch	Directing: oh my, IMNSHO ███████████ sucks, but someone trying to copy him sucks even harder Skip this one.
Kovida98	testing	Leo Gorcey	The film is harmless enough in its fashion although some may well take offense given how innocent Asians really did get singled out during the Second World War Overall though, it's a pretty generic effort and both ██████████ and Huntz Hall would have better moments, the best of which tend to come here when they ad-lib.
Kovida98	testing	Mr Gastineau	Well, the episode I just watched had the older "Gastineau Girl" whining about why people keep mentioning her husband (████████████, a famous American Football player apparently) 
Kovida98	testing	Darwin	In short the films lacks focus and respectability, it is quite easy to find the character anywhere in Africa and has nothing to do ██████'s nightmare or fish fillet...What a load of rubbish! 
Kovida98	testing	Richard Kelly	A box with a button provides a couple with the opportunity to be financially free, but the cost is the life of someone they've never met This is a very tedious film to watch █████████████, who wrote and directed it, decided to make a film without any payoff 
Kovida98	testing	Leni RiefenStahl	I was hoping this would be of the calibre of Das Boot and echo the stark realism created by acclaimed German Director ████████████████ in her documentaries, sadly I was monumentally disappointed
Kovida98	testing	Simpson	one song played through the whole film #stein couldn't act and in my opinion one of the worst I've seen #terrible ending #racist moment and stealing ███████'s character named the good points 
Kovida98	testing	Roslin	And ██████ is as annoying a character that's ever been put aboard a starship Out the airlock with her I could care less if it's six more months before they conclude
CurSpace	training	Holly	For my humanities quarter project for school, i chose to do human trafficking. After some research on the internet, i found this DVD and ordered it. I just finished watching it and I am still thinking about it. All I can say is "Wow". It is such a compelling story of a 12 year old Vietnamese girl named █████ and an American man named Patric who tries to save her. The ending leaves you breathless, and although it's not a happily-ever-after ending, it is very realistic.

CurSpace	training	Ron Livingston	"Holly" is an issue-driven film, but it is neither manipulative nor overly sentimental. At its heart is it is a character-driven film, which wouldn't be nearly so successful without the fleshed-out portrayals of Patrick (██████████████), the lost soul with the gradually awakening conscience, and Holly (Thuy Nguyen), the strong-willed but ultimately over-matched young Vietnamese girl. From the vibrant locations and photography to the effective editing, everything is forthright and well-done. The contemporary classical score may put some off at first, but it is top-notch composition and underscores the admirable restraint which is evident throughout. This film, which raises many issues but provides few clear-cut answers, ultimately succeeds in raising awareness of and compassion for Holly and the many who share her plight. Kudos to those who managed to get it made.

CurSpace	training	Ron Livington	Holly addresses the issue of child sexploitation that is rampant all over the world (some 2 million children are trafficked every year) and does so sensitively and without manipulation--a tall order that the team at Priority Films does with great success. American actor █████████████ stars in the film alongside newcomer Thuy Nguyen, a Vietnamese actress who plays Holly, and together they bring to screen what is commonplace to the people at the notorious k11 redlight district in Cambodia. Although it tackles a heavy topic, the film holds on to moments of laughter and hope as we get to know the characters up close, keeping the two-hour film from being one that is too difficult to watch. I am glad a film like this is bringing the world's attention to the problem. Child prostitution needs to be stopped and this is a very good first step. It's GREAT and a film EVERYONE must see.

CurSpace	training	James	I LOVED GOOD TIMES with the rest of many of you. I love reading INTELLIGENT and INSIGHTFUL commentary. The writers on THIS show were fantastic and the Actors were beyond TALENTED. To answer Strawberry22 (the neatest commentary to the other superior and positive commentary)...What happened was that █████ was killed in an accident (I believe I remember that it was a trucking accident or car accident) and it was the saddest episode (when it first aired and I was a tiny thing...it was so sad to me..).
CurSpace	training	Eric Monte	Back in 74 ██████████ made the classic T.V show Good Times. JJ has always been my favorite and I love watching the Reruns on T.V Land. Jimmie Walker always seemed to be the star and not Esther Rolle. John Amos most of the time felt a little jealous of Jimmie Walker's popularity winning millions of fans time to sit and watch Good Times. The show would have been dead if JJ would't have been there to save it with his always Kool Aid attitude. Drinking KOOL AID was like his favorite thing on the show. I was 3 when it came out and 8 when it ended. Instead of 1974-1979 it should have went longer like in the 1980's when I was just growing up.

CurSpace	training	Pitt	Great drama with all the areas covered EXCEPT for screenlay which was too slow and should have shown more relevant scenes like's character interviewing the President, getting murdered instead of just having it described to us.Scenes like those would have kept the audience awake.Cutting away some useless minutes could have made more room for more heartpounding scenes like those.The dragging of the film kept this one from all time greatness although to see ████ here makes the film so worth watching.Also,big fans of fising,early 20th century styles and Montana will really like this as well........
CurSpace	training	Michael	███████ Bowen plays an innocentish young man who hitchhikes a thousand miles to visit his absentee millionaire father (the creepy Ray Wise) at a sprawling, windmill-powered ranch and ends up tangled in the dangerous web of his young, scheming and seductive stepmother from hell (the yummy Clare Wren), thus causing trouble for the already dysfunctional family. An edgy, stylish and exciting drama that received no promotion and was sent straight to VHS and cable TV--where I first saw it. It is beautifully written, smartly acted, and tightly directed from a script that keeps you biting your nails. I cannot believe the reviewers who disliked it ever actually saw it. It is an undiscovered classic.

CurSpace	training	Black	This was what black society was like before the crack epidemics, gangsta rap, and AIDS that beset the ghettos in the eighties. Decent, hardworking families that struggled to get by and all the traumas and tribulations they faced. █████ America was a different group of people in the seventies. Still full of hope and flying high on the civil rights movements of the sixties, times were hard but still worth fighting for. Keepin' your head above water, making a wave when you can, this show showed how black society struggled to work together as people and families, before they started to prey on each other and everyone else in order to survive the horrors of the ghettos. It is heart-breaking to see what the black ghettos were like then and what they have become now.

CurSpace	training	Pauline	Like some of the other folks who have reviewed this film, I was also waxing nostalgic about it...before I had the misfortune to actually watch it again. Alas, my childhood memories of this film were completely untrustworthy, and The Perils of ███████ is now revealed to be an embarrassing exercise in banal, racist, and plain boring film-making. Even the presence of old pros Edward Everett Horton and Terry-Thomas can't overcome a rancid screenplay, a horrible theme song, and some wretched 'special effects'. In addition, the stereotypical depictions of African and Arab characters make for painful viewing, especially considering this was produced in the immediate wake of the Civil Rights movement. Judging from the results, that is a completely believable (and baffling) scenario.

Anyways this movie really has very little value other than to see how bad the 70's were for horror flicks Bad Effects, Bad Dialog, just bad movie making. Avoid this unless you want to laugh at it. While you are at HULU check out the other movies that are their right now there is 10 episodes and some are pretty decent movies with good plots and production and you can watch a lot of them in 480p as long as you have a decent speed connection.

CurSpace	training	Walter Pidgeon	I was surprised at how a movie could be both cheesy and excellent at the same time. The Frisbee flying saucer was naff beyond comprehension, especially when landing, yet the specially effects when the Krell attacked were awesome for a film that was made over half a century ago! Living in the middle east I saw shades of Islam creep in when JJ Adams suggested Alta should dress more modestly, and as an engineer, was amazed by the imagination used for the 'futuristic' gadgets, and gizmos dreamed up by the props department. All in all, an entertaining hour and a half, my first time seeing ██████████████ and a chance to see Leslie Neilsen as a 'young' man

I definitely recommend it as a rental, although some of the themes, which might have seemed a bit edgy in 1989, now may seem tame, which is a shame, considering that contemporary "edginess" is often just used as a necessary marketing tool, sort of like clamoring just to get noticed.

CurSpace	training	Caleb	It was a bit bizarre and evil and i enjoyed it a lot, the characters in the show were great as well, and complimented one another well. I was sorry to see it cut off.. I would have loved to see where it could have went.You found yourself leaning toward Lucas Buck the sheriff who had more secrets than anyone. Lucas was frightening and alluring. And I would have liked to have seen more of him and how his character became. I will however buy the show just to enjoy, it was great to something different on TV.

CurSpace	validation	Linda	█████ Lovelace was the victim of a sadistic woman hater, Chuck Traynor. I don't understand how having sex with a dog (which is animal abuse, as well) can be found to be entertaining or funny. I know some people will criticize this comment but I feel strongly that these types of films fuel the fire of hatred and further misogynistic feelings towards women. This society continues to portray women as sexual objects as opposed to human beings. We call ourselves "civilized" however I feel we have a long way to go before we can ever scratch the surface of being civilized.

I know some people will criticize this comment but I feel strongly that these types of films fuel the fire of hatred and further misogynistic feelings towards women. This society continues to portray women as sexual objects as opposed to human beings. We call ourselves "civilized" however I feel we have a long way to go before we can ever scratch the surface of being civilized.

CurSpace	validation	Pearce	This movie sucked. From beginning to end it was predictable. There was absolutly no chemistry between ██████ and the Mumba chick.

CurSpace	validation	Cherry	...but I would be lying. A relative was a crew member, and we got to go watch the production of this movie for a couple of days (and I was an extra). I get to die and have a second of screen time, not that I plan on moving to Hollywood anytime soon. I just thought it was awesome to see how movies are made and be a part of it. Plus, I got a copy of the movie once it was finally released. They didn't have a studio backing when making this film so it truly was independent. Why the writing and acting is so awful is beyond me, but the main character "██████" is the director's sister so that could be part of it. But the cinematography was good. 
CurSpace	validation	Kansas	Saw the film at it's Lawrence, ██████ premiere. This wavering story about a group of disgruntled highschoolers killing off the competition for prom queen was just awful. It fails for many reasons - bad acting, bad script, no clear point. But mainly it just felt like the filmmakers said to themselves - "Hey I have some money, so let's make a movie!" - without really thinking it out. Sorrowfully most indie films that don't make it suffer from just that mentality. They just don't seem to realize that it takes more than money to make a good movie... or in this case, even a watchable one. With this film I do not feel ashamed to say, that if I didn't know some of the crew, I would have walked out. Simple as that.
CurSpace	validation	Drew	There are worse ways to spend an evening than watching this movie, although it IS a tad predictable. ████ Barrymore does a very good job of being the outcast nerd in this film - excellent casting choice. (And does "Kole Slaw Food" really make HIM all that popular? I doubt it). I would have hoped she could have come up with a story long before the prom. A bit contrived. Having said all that, it was a cutsie piece of fluff that will be entertaining as long as you don't expect too much.

(And does "Kole Slaw Food" really make HIM all that popular? I doubt it). As for rooting for Drew's character to win big as a reporter - well, I would have hoped she could have come up with a story long before the prom. A bit contrived.

CurSpace	validation	Drew Barrymore	I think that Never Been Kissed was a totally awesome movie. The casting was really good and they acted very well. I really like ██████████████ and of course for me it was excellent. I was scared at first because it said that it wasn't coming out on video. Boy, am I happy that it is because it's a beyond cool movie. Go see it if you already haven't!
CurSpace	validation	Drew	████ Barrymore is such a great actress when it comes to these kind of movies. She stars wonderfully and gets away with the quirks and jokes.

CurSpace	validation	Drew Barrymore	After seeing this movie, I came to the realization that ██████████████ is a great actress. This movie wouldn't have been watchable without Drew. The fact that somebody as attractive as Drew, could actually gross me out, and she did when she was "Josie Grossie". Her attempts to "transition" as the cool girls called it were hilarious, especially her trying to dance at the night club.

CurSpace	validation	Drew Barrymore	I thought this movie was great, not only because of it's storyline but because it was portrayed greatly by the excellent cast. I read that ██████████████ wasn't exceptional as Josie Geller because she is beautiful. Yes she maybe but in the movie she played outside herself, which brought on a plain girl searching for who she is in the world. The story is sweet and definitely for the hopeless romantics out there, I for sure am. David Arquette is mad as her brother Rob, and Michael Vartan is gorgeous as Sam Coulson. Leelee Sobieski did an excellent job as her mate Aldys, someone who wasn't afraid to be herself. I think this movie should get more credit rather than being branded as a "teeny boppy" flick

SaiPrakash1997	validation	Karate Kid	Now of course there is the boy that likes her and the mean bullies that are pretty similar to the first ██████████, but I would recommend this one.

SaiPrakash1997	validation	Mallrats	Everybody should see ████████.. Only an idiot wouldn't like this movie.br
SaiPrakash1997	validation	Emily	However, I thought █████ was going to be the one to kill him, not the lady.
SaiPrakash1997	validation	Gary Sherman	But with its rather dull script and pedestrian direction from ████████████, even they can't save this movie from being a less than average production.
SaiPrakash1997	validation	Ray Charles	When ███████████ was little, he went blind and his mother didn't baby him.
SaiPrakash1997	validation	Holmes	Playing a high strung, distracted artistic type a far cry from his more familiar roles as either menacing villains or the coolly logical Sherlock ██████, Rathbone's character looks like he couldn't find his way out of bed without help.

SaiPrakash1997	validation	Stewart	The lead pairing is, in fact, one of the movie's few weaknesses the grayhaired ███████ seems a bit old for the role, and while it is easy to see why he falls hard for Novak, it's a little harder to understand what she finds attractive about him, as they seem mismatched in temperment and outlook.

SaiPrakash1997	testing	Jonathan Flora	The film makes a subtle and brilliantly presented point while interesting to watch.I had the privilege of running into ██████████████ when he was touring in Ohio.

SaiPrakash1997	testing	Meadows	███████ also gets across his feeling of foreboding and the sense its all building up to something.
SaiPrakash1997	testing	Cecilia	This film tries so hard to be it all that it becomes a walking clich especially the scene in which ███████ hands Arn her necklace is so incredibly cheesy, it hurts.
