cegme	training	ashton kutcher	I couldn't image ██████████████ in a serious role, but his performance truly
SarahBrown	training	Ashton Kutcher	I'll admit that I was reluctant to see it because from what I knew of ██████████████ he was only able to do comedy.
SarahBrown	training	Noonan	The acting is all up to ██████ and he carries his thankless character perfectly.
SarahBrown	training	Picasso	███████ was a finer draftsman and a brilliant artist at that age than many artists will ever become in a lifetime.
SarahBrown	training	Tom Noonan	The incredible performance by ██████████ is brilliant and provocative and the editing, sound design, cinematography and directing are truly inspired.
SarahBrown	training	Shabana Azmi	 Her Excellency Madam ████████████ has worked in countless movies over life time.
SarahBrown	training	Mehta	These two genres (i.e. deep meaningful alternative-love story and comic satire) usually mix together just as well as oil and water do, but █████ (somehow) manages to achieve the balance to near perfection.
SarahBrown	training	Mehta	While developing her primary subject matter, █████ manages to achieve this secondary theme skillfully.
SarahBrown	training	Ram	As legend goes, ███ subjugates his wife by making her walk through a Fire to prove her `purity.'
SarahBrown	training	Sita	████, in response, cries and leaves him, reuniting with her mother(the Earth).
SarahBrown	training	Ms Mehta	I guess the fact that so many women applauded ████████'s work, was because it provided them with an option to think for themselves.
SarahBrown	training	Ms Mehta	Bravo to ████████ in translating her vision so clearly.
SarahBrown	training	Radha	I especially like the flashbacks to the young █████ trying to 'see' for the ocean.
SarahBrown	training	A.R. Rahman	The movie is beautifully filmed and enhanced by the musical score by ███████████.
SarahBrown	training	Ashton Kutcher	██████████████ can act!
SarahBrown	training	Deepa Mehta's	"█████████████ ""Fire"" is groundbreaking, bold, and artistic."
SarahBrown	training	A.R. Rahman's	█████████████ music is the work of the genius and almost plays the role of another character in the film.
SarahBrown	training	Deepa Mehta	'Water' (2005), the final part of Toronto-based Indian film-director ███████████'s elemental trilogy has been finally completed, almost ten years after the release of the very first controversial element, 'Fire' (1996), which was followed with a slightly lesser controversial sequel '1947: Earth' (1998).
SarahBrown	training	Deepa Mehta	International fame followed ███████████ in 1996 with the release of the controversial 'Fire', which spread with rage among the false patriotic consciousness existing Indian extremist.
SarahBrown	training	Camilla	Having already explored friendship between two women in '███████', in 'Fire' Mehta went a step further to portray a more intimate relationship between two lonely neglected women.
SarahBrown	training	Kulbhushan Kharbanda	Set in modern day India, the suburbs of the capital city of New Delhi, it shows two brothers and their wives, the elder brother (████████████████████) having joined a weird Hindu sect leads a life of celibacy, faithful to his guru of sexless existence.
SarahBrown	training	Deepa Mehta's	 Two years later, █████████████ second installment was the element of mother earth, released in India by the name of '1947: Earth',yet another excellent movie by a great director, this time in the Hindi language, unlike 'Fire', which was made in the English language.
SarahBrown	training	Deepa Mehta	 Now ███████████ has managed to complete the trilogy, despite a lot of problems, having released the final installment recently, 'Water'.
SarahBrown	training	Nandita Das	The scene where ███████████ loses her virginity to her husband certainly was the first of its kind in Indian cinemas.
SarahBrown	training	Nandita Das	Good acting by all the actors especially ███████████ amidst criticism from the Indian public
SarahBrown	training	Deepa Mehta	I admire ███████████ and this movie is a masterpiece.
SarahBrown	training	Sita	████ still cared enough for him to find that moment to let him know that he is not responsible for her deviant outlet to her blocked desires.
SarahBrown	training	Sita	 But the final act of rejection was by the grandmother - she could not break free from her rusted mindset to accept ████'s desire.
SarahBrown	training	Mehta	"I finally watched the third film in █████'s trilogy: ""Fire""."
SarahBrown	training	Mehta	 █████ is one brave lady: she sees with a clear eye much that is jaundiced, false and repressive about the great society from which she came from.
SarahBrown	training	Mehta	Worse, if someone like █████ has the courage to hold up a mirror to these issues, she faces death threats.
SarahBrown	training	Mehta	█████ is clearly impatient with the totally rigid religious attitudes that either keep widows in misery (Water) or else keep women enslaved to loveless marriages (Fire).
SarahBrown	training	Mehta	In any case █████'s film is a very moving, powerful attempt at sexual discourse that holds modern Indian relationships up to probing scrutiny.
SarahBrown	training	Mehta	█████ is forcing the issues to be looked at no matter how much flack.
SarahBrown	training	Superb	██████, disturbing, provocative, taboo shattering.
SarahBrown	training	Kevin Costner	The trailers looked good, but the water theme was giving me bad flashbacks to the last █████████████ movie that dealt with the subject - Waterworld.
SarahBrown	training	Ashton Kutcher	Plus, despite the promise ██████████████ showed in The Butterfly Effect, I'm still not completely sold on him.
SarahBrown	training	Kenny Rogers'	The movie immediately throws us into the midst of a tense rescue mission, and I was gripped tighter than █████████████ orange face lift.
SarahBrown	training	George Clooney	Sunglasses, a tough guy toothpick in his mouth, and sportin' a smirk that'd make ██████████████ proud?
SarahBrown	training	Costner	I had a bad feeling that the pace would slow too much when ███████ started training the young guys, but on the contrary, the training sessions just might be the most interesting aspect of the film.
SarahBrown	training	Deepa Mehta's	█████████████ somewhat mis-titled FIRE is the first of a loosely connected trilogy, here linked by the theme of the elements, and more symbolic than consuming.
SarahBrown	training	Sita	One husband married a vivacious young woman, ████, out of family obligation.
SarahBrown	training	Sita	This arranged marriage is uncomfortable for them both but in the beginning ████ makes an attempt to connect with her sullen husband.
SarahBrown	training	Sita	However, he sees himself as a victim and could have cared less about ████--and he continues to have an affair with a liberal-minded Chinese lady.
SarahBrown	training	Sita	In their dead marriage, sex was purely meant to produce children and there was no way ████ could have any of her sexual or emotional needs met.
SarahBrown	training	Deepa Mehta	By the way, director ███████████ (a popular female director) has made several other wonderful films such as EARTH and BOLLYWOOD/Hollywood.
SarahBrown	training	Deepa Mehta	This is my first ███████████ film.
SarahBrown	training	Mehta	█████'s film of two bisexual ladies in an Indian middle-class household may be sacrilege to some, but merely captures the atrophy of middle-class homes that does not seem to aspire for something better than its immediate survival in a limited social space.
SarahBrown	training	Claudio Carvalho	Previous reviewer ████████████████ gave a much better recap of the film's plot details than I could.
SarahBrown	training	William Faulkner's	This intelligent, moving and beautiful film is a study in the ways people react to tradition (reminds me of ██████████████████ novels).
SarahBrown	training	Ashton	I am happy to say that ██████ is great in this part.
SarahBrown	validation	Ben Randall	"However, the use of humor, the exploration of the toughness of the training and the fun of watching ███████████ ""do his own thing as a trainer"", kept me riveted and thoroughly entertained."
SarahBrown	validation	Shabana Azmi	To my mind, the very character played by ████████████ is a symbol of the Indian feminine protest against the Indian society.
SarahBrown	validation	Nandita Das	I was impressed with ███████████, who was quite attractive, and played her character with total earnestness.
SarahBrown	validation	Shabana Azmi	But I was even more impressed with ████████████, who I understand is a long-time fixture of Bollywood.
SarahBrown	validation	Oldboy	"Besides the apparent connections with ""██████"" (and Park-wook's other films), an incestuous relation in this one really disturbed me, and also the subtle erotic theme that hung around all the vampiric, physical action."
SarahBrown	validation	Stanley Kubrick	Park-wook has really, really mastered his cinematography in this film, and owes a lot to ███████████████; there are a whole lot of beautiful shots strewn throughout the film, some for simple effects and some that require several glances and probably repeated views to fully catch.
SarahBrown	validation	Chan-wook Park's	████████████████ new film is a complex film that is not easy to classify.
SarahBrown	validation	Emile Zola's	"The film takes its own matters and mixes them with classic European literature, in this case ████████████ ""Thérèse Raquin""."
SarahBrown	validation	Chan-wook Park's	Although I've never seen the film, I couldn't help but feel like this was ████████████████ version of Twilight.
SarahBrown	validation	Park	The psychological aspect that I love about ████'s previous films is in Thirst, as well.
SarahBrown	validation	Chan-wook Park	██████████████ bites into the vampire mythology with Thirst and puts his own dark, psychological twist on it.
SarahBrown	validation	Park Chan-wook	Anything ██████████████ creates is guaranteed to be unique, brilliant, and very twisted at a minimum.
SarahBrown	validation	Park Chan-wook	As negative as it may sound the positives definitely outweigh the negatives and another volume has without a doubt been added to the dark and twisted Zeitgeist of ██████████████ film.
SarahBrown	validation	Bakjwi	That was not the case when I watched ██████, under the American title Thirst.
SarahBrown	validation	Bakjwi	 There aren't many negatives I can say about ██████.
SarahBrown	validation	Dracula	"""bakjwi"" literally means bat in korean and we all know that in many classic vampire stories, you see count ███████ or vampires turning into a bat and fly away or wuheva."
SarahBrown	validation	aesop	Duality of human nature = if you ever read █████'s fables, there is this one fable where mammals and birds are fighting and a bat just can't seem to take a side and it tries to play both sides to his advantage.
SarahBrown	validation	Chan-wook Park	██████████████ is a master of cinematography and this movie is no exception.
SarahBrown	validation	Chan-wook Park	██████████████ is no stranger to controversy as we know, and this film touches on taboo almost as much as oldboy.
SarahBrown	validation	Hyeon	Instead of legitimately dying, █████ becomes a vampire, always yearning for the sustenance blood gives for him to fight off an infectious disease which returns causing the symptoms which flat-lined him to begin with(..bumps/sores, and the body vomits blood).
SarahBrown	validation	Hyeon	Sunlight, as is known in the vampire genre, causes torturous death if exposed to █████ for a length of time.
SarahBrown	validation	Hyeon	In doing so, █████ has created a monster.
SarahBrown	validation	Park Chan-Wook	██████████████ throws that concept completely out the window and shows directly what he wants--and what he wants to show is pretty much anything he can think of.
SarahBrown	validation	Park	Leaving it to the actors and dialog to create subtlety, from a stylistic perspective ████ seems willing to do just about anything to get his point across.
SarahBrown	validation	Chan-Wook	█████████ adds some much needed humour into the film, but this is only realised in the final third of the movie.
SarahBrown	validation	Park Chun-wook's	'Thirst' is original, entertaining and fortunately a little less weird than ████████████████ earlier endeavors.
SarahBrown	validation	Chan-wook Park	██████████████, you have to hand it to the guy.
SarahBrown	validation	Clancy Brown	"Co-star ████████████ (HBO's ""Carnivale"" - great to see him again) played the captain of the Coast Guard's Kodiak, Alaska base in a strong, convincing role as a leader with the prerequisite and necessary ice water in his veins."
SarahBrown	validation	Sang	There's nothing terribly weepy or insipid with the story and characters at any point, and the implications put forth from religion early on (████, for example, is seen as a healer of sorts since he rose from the dead thanks to his vampirism, even as he just can't be that and knows it) on top of those about good vs evil, push it up into another plane cinematically.
SarahBrown	validation	Chan-wook Park	Korean cinema has the ability to turn genres on its head, and the latest by the celebrated director ██████████████ is a tale of a good pious priest who becomes a vampire.
SarahBrown	testing	Kevin Costner	The mentor this time is played perfectly by █████████████; An ordinary man with common everyday problems who lives an extraordinary conviction, to save lives.
SarahBrown	testing	Costner	While his scenes with the local love interest are a tad stiff and don't generate enough heat to melt butter, he compliments ███████ well.
SarahBrown	testing	Leonard Maltin	Well, I have to disagree with ██████████████ on this animated short.
SarahBrown	testing	Bob McKimson	Director ████████████ offers endless laughters by means of absurd and unexpected demonstrative humour.
SarahBrown	testing	Maria Von Trapp	"It will be the death of ███████████████"" Fascinating study on changing an image."
SarahBrown	testing	Julie	█████ is beautiful and uses her many talents, throughout the film.
SarahBrown	testing	Julie Andrews	Fun, entertaining movie about WWII German spy (█████████████!)
SarahBrown	testing	Rosie Perez	Had to do a double take when I saw that was ███████████ there.
SarahBrown	testing	Merkerson	But, overall a great film with a truly outstanding performance by █████████.
SarahBrown	testing	Ruben Santiago Hudson	Of course, none of this would have been possible if █████████████████████ hadn't written his wonderful play.
wboncal	training	Patrick Deware	'Gerard and the late ██████████████ are two bitch-slapping, hippy drifters with many sexual insecurities, going around molesting women and committing petty crimes.

wboncal	training	Eddie Murphy	A strange role for ████████████ to take at the height of his career.
wboncal	training	Olivia DeHavilland	An excellent period murder melodrama, with Fontaine effectively playing against her earlier naive wallflower type, in a role that reportedly ██████████████████ turned down.
wboncal	training	Sofia Loren	She is ███████████, who is the wife of brutish public servant and mother of six children.
wboncal	training	John Holmes	Just saying you've got a movie about ███████████ is a guarantee to get some folks in front of the screen, but writer/director James Cox delivers oh so much more.

wboncal	training	Show People	Prior to seeing ███████████, my impression of silent comedy was essentially slapstick, and slapstick only.
wboncal	training	Tim Krabbé	The great plot comes from the novel by ██████████, who also adapted this story for the screen.

wboncal	training	Leslie Nielsen	Some will probably see this film simply to catch a glimpse of young, good-looking ██████████████ in one of his first starring roles.

wboncal	training	Sean Young	By all reports, ██████████ proves a weird person, and she is scarcely beautiful.
wboncal	training	Jamie Foxx	I had no expectations; I'd never heard of ██████████; all I knew was that the film has some strong character actors in it.
wboncal	training	Jane Russell	The sketch that brought the house down had them in a pub, wearing flat caps and mufflers, fantasising about movie stars such as ████████████ and Greta Garbo.

wboncal	training	Shannon Elizabeth	The beatiful █████████████████ (American Pie)did her first major movie role.
wboncal	training	Mike Binder	That, I think, is the main message ███████████'s newest film Reign Over Me brings across.

wboncal	validation	Ned Kelly	Ledger plays █████████ with dignity and intensity, showing us how an highly spirited boy became Australia's most notorious killer.

usma92	training	Matthew Rhys	████████████ performance of the stupid boy coming to big London and sudden taking drugs from people he does noteven know does not seem very credible,
usma92	training	Chris Cooper	The film boasts an incredible performance from ████████████ who shows an amazing versatility in the exploration of his role.
usma92	training	Patricia Clarkson	█████████████████ is equally as stellar and realistic in a role that many actresses would crumble in.

usma92	training	David Boreanaz	██████████████ gives a wonderful performance as the adult male who clearly gets himself into more trouble than he can handle.
usma92	training	John Hazlett	This information was actually confirmed by the director himself ████████████ at the Q&A after the film.
usma92	training	John Hazlett	I had the pleasure of meeting ████████████ tonight who seemed like a very nice guy and was very appreciative of the comments made about the film.
usma92	training	Keith Clark	But this summer is going to be a special one as they all blackmail ███████████ 
usma92	training	Caroline Dhavernas	(██████████████████) is the ringleader who basically doesn't know what to do with her life after High School
usma92	training	Thomas Jane	It had been a while since i seen it, but it does feature ███████████ in the first role i seen him in.
usma92	training	Paulina Porizkova	█████████████████ is dressed as a cheerleader type, looking very fresh and hot.
usma92	training	Tom Selleck	Sexy and lethal, like in the one movie with ███████████, but with a never seen before malevolence.
usma92	training	Aaron Eckhart	I stumbled onto it at the video store and rented it because █████████████
usma92	training	Mickey Rourke	For you █████████████ fans...
usma92	training	Bock	I said 'no ████ don't do it. You're a doctor, a healer, you're a necessary person, you're life is meaningful'.
usma92	training	George C. Scott	Black comedy features a 'tour-de-force' performance from veteran actor ███████████████
usma92	training	Scott	Hospital is as black of a comedy as "Network" is, and the excellent cast, led by the incomparable █████, does his work full justice.
usma92	training	Pepe Le Pew	This short, a formative cartoon featuring ███████████ , concerns a cat who thinks he'll solve all his problems by pretending to be a skunk.
usma92	training	Betty Boop	After all, ██████████ was in part responsible for the Production Code coming into existance.
usma92	training	Aihara	██████, an aloof girl, will definitely make the viewers ponder who IS behind the aloof girl.
usma92	training	Yoshida	Does she love ████████
usma92	training	Ito	Or does she love ████
usma92	training	Alastair Sim	This film is funny, having great sight gags and ████████████ is great.
usma92	validation	Bill Paxton	Actor turned director ███████████ follows up his promising debut, the Gothic-horror "Frailty", with this family friendly sports drama about the 1913 U.S. Open
usma92	validation	Harry Vardon	The movie depicted well the psychological battles that ████████████ fought within himself,
usma92	validation	Shia Lebouf	I didn't realize how charming ███████████ could be.
usma92	validation	Josh Flitter	And ████████████ as the ten year old caddy threatens to steal every scene in which he appears.
usma92	validation	Stephen Dillane	███████████████ is excellent as usual,
usma92	validation	Francis	But despite these handicaps, ███████ displays courage, spirit, heroism, and humility at this world class event.
usma92	validation	Hongsheng	Maybe I'm reading into this too much, but I wonder how much of a hand █████████ had in developing the film.
usma92	validation	Jia Hongsheng	I found the █████████████ story interesting.
usma92	validation	Lennon	Like ██████, he has gained success without a loss of identity.
usma92	validation	John Lennon	His devotion to The Beatles and ███████████ is a great metaphor for his life and the helplessness he feels.
usma92	validation	Custer	The film chronicles ██████ from the moment that he arrives at West Point Academy until the Indians massacre him at the Little Big Horn.
usma92	validation	Sheridan	Indeed, ████████ was a lieutenant at this point.
usma92	validation	Moreland	So much so that in one scene it looked like it might have been ████████ hamming it up in a dress.
usma92	validation	Mickael Curtiz	After working on 7 movies with director ██████████████ (The Adventures of Robin Hood are their best achievement),
usma92	validation	Bette Davis	This is worth stressing, as he was often derided as an actor by ███████████ et al.
usma92	validation	Spencer Tracy	much better than the much vaunted █████████████ or many other stars could have done.
usma92	validation	Anthony Quinn	the young █████████████ getting a start as Crazy Horse
usma92	validation	Madonna	Plus, the acting was great, and ███████ is my idol and she did a phat job!
usma92	validation	Griffin Dunne	█████████████ plays the hapless future groom/puppet who is sent to escort her from prison to the bus station, where a series of unfortunate events occurs, thus creating the plot.
usma92	validation	Mozart	So this movie is to "The Godfather" as new wave music is to ██████.
usma92	validation	Joe Estevez	███████████ may not have his brothers career, but does a good job of bringing focus to the story
usma92	validation	Ed Harris	And █████████ will win for BEST SUPPORTING ACTOR.
usma92	validation	Cuba Gooding	Then there is a black retarded frightened but pleasant fellow, ████████████,
usma92	validation	Stewart	The rest of the film is a puzzle as ███████ tries to save them and solve the mystery.
usma92	validation	Albert Hall	The final scene takes place in ███████████ and is one of the most famous in film which lasts for 12 minutes with no dialog.
usma92	validation	Alfred Hitchcock	████████████████ shall always remain over the top of any directors of his time.
usma92	validation	Truffaut	████████ argued that the earlier version of "The Man Who Knew Too Much" lacked the depth of the later version.
usma92	validation	Reggie Malder	The casting of character actor █████████████ as the assassin, is brilliant.
usma92	validation	Max Fleischer	This was another in the series of excellent cartoons █████████████ produced for Paramount Studio.
usma92	validation	Lois Lane	With intrepid reporter █████████ as the only passenger on board,
usma92	testing	Randolph Scott	As usual, ██████████████ put in another relaxed and realistic performance.
usma92	testing	Fritz Lang	However, for the life of me, I have no idea why ██████████ was assigned to direct this film--after all, he knew nothing about Westerns.
usma92	testing	Dean Jagger	While nice guy ███████████ (sporting lots of hair) did his best to get this done, there was a bad guy just waiting to undo this for his own selfish reasons.
usma92	testing	Clive Barker	████████████, the man who brought "Hellraiser", makes a horror movie that is part-Goth, part-Mythology, and all horror in-between.
usma92	testing	Danny Elfman	The ████████████ composed score is as good as it gets, and is among his best work.
usma92	testing	Doug Bradley	The rest of the cast, which includes ████████████ is very good, save for the ridiculously over the top redneck sheriff.
usma92	testing	David Cronenberg	I love this movie, even though, as many of the reviewers have noted, the expressions of the actors (with the exception of ████████████████, who does a wonderful appearance) are rather tacky.
usma92	testing	Vincent D'Onofrio	On the outside, this film is better because of █████████████████ (Law & Order: Criminal Intent), but this film is equally as good as the 1982 version.
usma92	testing	Shemp	One of My favorite Stooges shorts with █████ is none other than Brideless Groom!
usma92	testing	Curly	I prescribe 'Brideless Groom' as medicine for anyone who thinks the Stooges' glory years ended when █████ left.
xingqidi	training	Brokeback Mountain	I have recently seen this movie due to Jake's recent success with ██████████████████.
xingqidi	training	Darth Vader	His journey carries the movie as he moves closer to his confrontation with ███████████ and his fate.
xingqidi	training	Al Pacino	And of course you have █████████ in a rather small supporting role but he's absolutely brilliant at it and outshines and overshadows every other actor in the film.
xingqidi	training	David Strathairn	Needing a role in that mold, we are given a nice turn from ████████████████.
xingqidi	training	John Forsythe	Leading the investigation is █████████████, but the other three detectives are great as well.
xingqidi	training	Citizen Kane	"This adjective describes the performers; the characters; the chemistry between and among all of the characters, in whatever combination presented, and all of the supporting and even minor roles.I love films with a ""harder edge:"" ""Rounders;"" the escapist Schwarzenegger/Stallone fare; ""Goodfellows;"" even the classics like ""Casablanca,"" ""Gone With the Wind,"" ""████████████."""
xingqidi	training	Stanley Holloway	To the new Burgundians, however, this is an unexpected opportunity to live as they please, free from any interference from Whitehall.████████████████ is excellent as the minor city politician who suddenly finds himself leading one of the world's tiniest nations.
xingqidi	training	Abraham Lincoln	We all know of ███████████████ as the 16th president that did the emancipation and after the Civil war got assassinated.
xingqidi	training	Alpha Video	I love buying those cheap, lousy DVD's from ███████████.
xingqidi	training	Robert Montgomery	"It was a careful choice - Sanders usually would play villains with occasional ""nice roles"" (ffoliott in FOREIGN CORRESPONDENCE, the title hero in THE STRANGE CASE OF UNCLE HARRY, the framed ""best friend"" of █████████████████ in RAGE IN HEAVEN)."
xingqidi	training	Frank Sinatra	Seeing █████████████ when he was very young and extremely thin with sunken in cheeks and a wonderful voice which sang some great old songs.
xingqidi	training	Walt Disney	It's the same guy who maid the music for ███████████'s version of Zorro, who maid the Fightin Legion music.
xingqidi	training	Brighton Rock	"I think I saw ""█████████████"" once many years ago and liked it but maybe I'm simply thinking fondly of the novel.)"
xingqidi	training	Donkey Kong	Everything from the speaking to the SFX are pleasant and realistic.The camera angle is a bit frustrating at times, but it's the same for every platform game, like Banjo-Kazooie and ███████████ 64.I got this game as a Christmas present in 1997, and since then, I have dutifully gotten 120 stars over 10 times.
xingqidi	training	Ralph Richardson	"There is far more human life in this part though, with the great ████████████████ sailing gloriously over-the-top as the small dictator, the ""Boss"" of the Everytown."
xingqidi	training	Greg Kinnear	"Add the kind-hearted, uber-likable American ""guy next door', ████████████, to set up contrast."
xingqidi	training	David Baddiel	I believe the minimal sound design and cheap camera is a conscious decision rather than bad film making, I'd defend this, the film isn't any worse as a result, and it puts the spotlight on the cast, some of whom are really good (Kate Hardie- think that's her name, as the sarcastic drunk is spot-on) the one exception being █████████████, who should never be allowed to appear in serious stuff!!
xingqidi	training	Ella Raines	Sadly ███████████ was never given such a great part again, and eventually ended up in poorly produced westerns.
xingqidi	training	Paul Lukas	"Everyone is entitled to compare films they choose, but the similarities of ""The Mortal Storm"" and ""Watch On The Rhine"" are clearly the problems of refugees threatened by the Nazi juggernaut, while the main comparative point brought out with ""Casablanca"" is the seeming unjust treatment of Humphrey Bogart in 1943 by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Science, because they chose ██████████ instead for the Best Actor Oscar."
xingqidi	training	Ciaran Hinds	(IMO the newer A&E production suffers in that ████████████ - whom I normally adore - seems to bluster and bully his way throughout.
xingqidi	training	Marin Preda	This tells something certainly about the value, or maybe about the lack of universality of the film, but also tells something about how different history and even life of common people was in Romania compared to other countries, even in Eastern Europe.The film is an adaptation of a novel by ███████████, a controversial novelist who died during the Communist rule soon after the book was published.
xingqidi	training	Marc Dixon	"""Where the Sidewalk Ends,"" a fairly difficult to find film -- the only copy in perhaps the best stocked video store in Manhattan was a rough bootleg from the AMC cable channel -- belongs in a category with these classics.From the moment the black cloud of opening credits pass, a curtain is drawing around rogue loner detective ██████████'s crumbling world, and as the moments pass, it inches ever closer, threatening suffocation."
xingqidi	training	Simon Peacock	It's a very gory start, and bodes well for the rest of the film.Unfortunately, after this promising beginning, things start to go seriously downhill: we are introduced to the main characters, an annoying bunch of twenty-somethings just begging to become cannibal chow, and are subjected to a fair amount of time wasting in the form of some terrible false scares, a lot of blarney about murderous druids from local Irish weirdo Gary (█████████████), and worst of all, some sub-Scream, post-modernistic conversation about the conventions of horror films (how clever!
xingqidi	training	Academy Award	It may not be █████████████ material but it is absolutely guaranteed to turn a bad day into a darn good one.
xingqidi	training	James C. Petrillo	Both of them were denounced by the president of the union, █████████████████ as strikebreakers and both did not cross the picket line again.
xingqidi	training	Nicholas Cage	It's the best role that I have ever seen for █████████████, but almost everybody seems perfectly cast.
xingqidi	training	Will Smith	I have the Highest Respects for ██████████ as he is not only a brilliant Actor but one can tell he has a genuine love for people and life which no doubt made him perfect for the character (IRS Agent Ben Thomas) he played in this film.
xingqidi	training	Paul Reiser	Obviously this is a labor of love for ███████████ who understands what it's like to be both a father and a son, as well as to have both laughter and tears as you move through life.
xingqidi	training	Alistair Cooke	It expands their critical thinking.Impartially, with the participants on all sides explaining in their own words what they did and why, it details what lead up to the war and the actual war.Buy it for your children, along with ██████████████'s America.
xingqidi	training	Heero Yuy	"Purists can stick to Japanese all they want, but for a more ""realistic"" experience i recommend the English track since all the characters, except █████████, are not Japanese."
xingqidi	training	Mr. Wells	He did not direct after this Sci-Fi epic opera he and █████████ created, but his film imagery, sets, and design are very recognizable.That imagery is very effecting.
xingqidi	training	Mélanie Thierry	And the only one time where he was weakened is when ███████████████ shaved his beard !
xingqidi	training	Al Pacino	A lot of people are saying that █████████ over acted but I mean common obviously for a movie role like this -- a cuban drug lord you need a bit of over acting in this role with that cuban accent.
xingqidi	training	Michael Parks	Also █████████████ as modern sheriff is a bit underused in his role.
xingqidi	training	Harlan Ellison	It reminds me of ██████████████'s spooky short story, FLOP SWEAT.
xingqidi	training	Gary Busey	Unfortunately, ██████████'s role was too small and limited.
xingqidi	training	Robin Hood	This must have been very hep for 1936, but rather way way out and had nothing to do with the film, ██████████ did not make an appearance as far as I could see.
xingqidi	training	Art Director Dave Milton	This was also the first time that ████████████████████████ got a chance to spread his wings.
xingqidi	training	Michael Jackson	It's a kind of strange combination of a bio of ███████████████, a collection of musical vignettes, and a story about a super hero fighting to save some little kids.
xingqidi	training	Family Guy	Father of the Pride was the best new show to hit television since ██████████.
xingqidi	training	Harrison Ford	This is the man that made █████████████ run hard and run fast.
xingqidi	training	John Fulton	The special effects, by the always innovative ███████████, are terrific and the supporting actors are all adequate.
xingqidi	training	Imaginary Heroes	!i first got into ryan from watching the OC and then saw him in a bunch of good indies like ████████████████.
xingqidi	training	Dark Heart	Than the club & cousin bears have grown up to get ready to fight ██████████.
xingqidi	training	Sir Alan Sugar	!For fans of this i highly recommend the UK version starring ██████████████ as the boss.
xingqidi	training	Herbert Hoover	Madison is a carefree happy-go-lucky if rather irresponsible slob who's refrigerator was last cleaned probably when ██████████████ was still in the White House.
xingqidi	training	Picture Oscar	It also won the Best █████████████, being the first - and only - X-rated motion picture to do so.
xingqidi	training	Al Pacino	In a role he was born to play, █████████ stars as New York's mayor who has to deal with the shooting of a boy.
xingqidi	training	Nancy Drew	It also has encouraged my daughter to start reading the original ██████████ mysteries which I am sure she will love much as I loved the Hardy Boys.
xingqidi	training	Jane Eyre	I watched this film and then █████████ right after... she just keeps getting better.
xingqidi	validation	George Stevens	"However the continual forays into comedy  such as the spiked punch routine  make this ""slow"" portion bearable.Producer-director ██████████████ was a natural when it came to this sort of thing, himself having cut his teeth at the Hal Roach studios, and almost exclusively having directed comedy up to this point."
xingqidi	validation	Gentleman Jim	Typical forties flick teeming w/ familiar faces and fast paced scenes, one after the other.Flynn is fine as █████████████, you never get past a 1 dimensional look at him or the rest here, I suppose, but it's okay, it's a cartoon and meant to please, that's all.
xingqidi	validation	Grace Elliot	Rohmer returns to his historical dramas in the real story of ████████████, an Englishwoman who stayed in France during the apex of the French Revolution.
xingqidi	validation	Chloe Franks	The most outstanding contribution, however, is that of the 7-year-old ████████████ who turns in chillingly effective account of her part which makes one's blood run cold.
xingqidi	validation	Miranda Richardson	It says something when ██████████████████ does her usual fine work and yet is overshadowed by so many others in the cast.
xingqidi	validation	Deep Space	The cast and crew have truly come up with something special here, and, as a whole,I would highly recommend this series to fans of The Next Generation and ██████████ 9.
xingqidi	validation	Seijun Suzuki	It just feels very fresh and original, with some imaginative use of sets and lighting, and some hints to █████████████ and Jean-Pierre Melville.
xingqidi	validation	Weird Al	I was always a big ████████ fan and when I saw this video I rented and watched it.
xingqidi	validation	Guy Kibbee	Besides those already mentioned, ██████████ is at his flustered best here.7 out of 10
xingqidi	validation	Please Obey	!Here's a message to all those brave sainik(soldier)-sons please respect the father of the nation!███████████ and happiness shall be bestowed or else it's a disaster in waiting,isn't it?
xingqidi	validation	Brock Lesnar	WWE Intercontenital championship: RVD v. ████████████ 8/10 This was a very intense and good match.
xingqidi	validation	Patrick Warburton	As a man married for 26 years, I empathize with █████████████████'s character: he loves his wife, but he assumes she knows that.
xingqidi	validation	Robert Louis Stevenson	Based on ██████████████████████'s St. Ives, the film tells the story of a dashing young French Hussar captain (Jean Marc Barr) during the Napoleonic wars.
xingqidi	validation	Franka Pontente	An excellent example of a simple idea developed into a compelling 90 minute script.The set up requires no bells and whistles, no lengthy exposition or wordy back story; Kate (███████████████), a young German business woman living in London, drifts off whilst waiting for the last tube train.
xingqidi	validation	Randy Edelman	Not only do the exteriors look authentically bleak (shot exclusively in the most run-down parts of otherwise spectacular Budapest), but █████████████'s soaring soundtrack is entirely overwhelming--and frequently our only respite from the bleak brutality.
xingqidi	validation	Dirty Harry	Despite the other comments listed here, this is probably the best ███████████ movie made; a film that reflects -- for better or worse -- the country's socio-political feelings during the Reagan glory years of the early '80's.
xingqidi	validation	Basic Instinct	She was just as good as she was in the first ██████████████.
xingqidi	validation	Steve Martin	Davis (████████████ with a great beard) asks himself 'Is my making a violent movie (and by extension our enjoyment of it) causing the violence in society?'
xingqidi	validation	Conrad L. Hall	And along the way, savor the visual brilliance of cinematographer ██████████████ (9 nominations, 2 oscars for best cinematography): rain pouring off fedoras, shots through mirrors (especially on swinging doors), tommy-gun flashes from out of the shadows, absent any sound.
xingqidi	validation	Bill Sikes	Lacking in judgment, she ignores ██████████' violent nature out of her deep need for love.
xingqidi	validation	Miss Europe	"The tango also plays a plot point in ""Prix,"" being the music she danced with on her short rise to stardom after becoming ███████████."
xingqidi	validation	Grace Hartman	█████████████, who died of cancer at age 48, did almost no film work, so it's a real pleasure that this film gives us a rare chance to see her close-up, to hear her beautiful singing voice and to notice how sexy she looks in her maid's uniform.
xingqidi	validation	Joseph Goebbels	Unarmed, unorganized, and leaderless, they faced down the most brutal forces at the disposal of the Third Reich.███████████████, the Gauleiter (governor or district leader) of Berlin, anxious to have that city racially cleansed, was also in charge of the nation's public morale.
xingqidi	validation	Bill Paxton	After all it's not everyday that someone comes in to your office to tell you that he knows who the killer is.The film has many twists, and ███████████ directs splendidly by keeping us guessing without losing interest.
xingqidi	validation	John Speredakos	This angers some of the locals--especially Otis (███████████████) and things slowly (VERY slowly) go wrong.I was expecting the worst when I started watching this.
xingqidi	validation	Ralph Faulkner	"I also like the way he dispenses with Sebastian in the first episode.I watched this again because I had good memories of it from years back, there are some good stunts and good music, it has the ingredients you expect including water,rockfalls,runaway carts... Apart from the first episode(with ██████████████)the swordplay wasn't nearly as good as I remembered it, and yes it features the inevitable ""flashback"" episode!"
xingqidi	validation	Julie Delpy	"The primary reason to see ""Before Sunrise,"" is to watch a young ███████████ deliver her lines."
xingqidi	validation	John Ford	My guess is that █████████ wanted him as a sympathetic character to give movie fans some rooting interest.
xingqidi	validation	Desert Island	"Like the ""█████████████"" game, the film looks at how even best friends, when left alone together, can fall apart, but at the same time it shows that friends are vital to the quality of existence."
xingqidi	validation	Archibald Cunningham	Tim Roth masterfully portrays his major adversary and surely one of the most heinous and sadistic cinematic villains, ████████████████████, an egotistical, ruthless strutting peacock.
xingqidi	testing	Riff Randell	It tells the story of ████████████, adorably played by P.J.
xingqidi	testing	Robert Downey Jr	But like I said before, it's hard not to love any movie with ████████████████.
xingqidi	testing	De Sica	Neo-realism, by the way, could rightfully be claimed as this being a forefather (along with ███████'s The Children Are Watching Us), which that would take shape after the war.
xingqidi	testing	Harry Cohn	"Tone/Neal/Welles are only a few -and this includes a butchered film called ""The Lady From Shanghai""...""Lady From Shanghai"" took two years to be released, thanks to extensive re-editing -and all because Columbia president ██████████ couldn't understand the story."
xingqidi	testing	Pierce Brosnon	Not to mention easily ██████████████'s best performance.
xingqidi	testing	Jeffrey Goines	At the same time, Cole continues talking about a dream he keeps having in which she also plays a part as a blonde woman running down the aisle, screaming for help, after shots have rung out and a particular red-headed man in a ponytail (██████████████?)
xingqidi	testing	James Bond	But overall, this game is the best ██████████ experience so far.
xingqidi	testing	Jeremy Northam	With a beautiful setting, wonderful costumes, and an outstanding cast (have I mentioned the gorgeous ██████████████?
xingqidi	testing	Dil Wale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge	Easily the best film produced in Bollywood this century.The only other Indian film I would give 10/10 for is █████████████████████████████.
xingqidi	testing	Red Queen	In fact, all the visuals are interesting with the laughing █████████ running across the bridge at night being one of my favorite moments in the film.
