RamRao	training	Sadako	In Jôji Iida's "Rasen", ██████ explained that the reason behind her curse towards unfortunates was for others to experience pure fear, the same kind of fear she went through all alone at the bottom of a darkened well.
RamRao	training	Sadako	<br /><br />In Norio Tsuruta's "Bâsudei", the "██████" series continues, except this time we follow a young woman, named ██████(Yukie Nakama), haunted by a ghoulish alter ego with considerable power.
RamRao	training	Hiroshi Tôyama	A sound effects engineer, ██████████████(Seiichi Tanabe), seems to be the only one who accepts her without contention, actually encouraging once she receives the leading role after the actress dies under suspicious, and very unusual, circumstances.
RamRao	training	Sadako	The troupe and crew soon come to the understanding, thanks to a news reporter who instigates a lynch mob after the director(..who initiates a traumatic situation, accusing ██████, an actress he put in position to become a star, of killing the lead actress)is found murdered, his body discovered by a stage hand, that they are accursed(..her photographer's snapshots reveal their distorted faces and other disturbing images).
RamRao	training	Sadako	<br /><br />A different approach to the "Ringu" series this time making ██████ a sympathetic figure, a young woman tormented by others when, in fact, she is as much a victim as those whose lives are harmed by the vengeful ghoul.
RamRao	training	Sadako	The ghoul is, in a sense, ██████'s "protector", a kind of spectre that haunts the theater, and we see how the troupe and crew always respond to our heroine with disdain and disregard.
RamRao	training	Sadako	Tôyama becomes her sole friend and confident and their blossoming romance is the heart and soul of "Ringu 0-Birthday", as he attempts to rescue her from all those that find ██████ a threat..to no avail.
RamRao	training	Sadako	We see how the reporter finds ██████, understanding her past(..including ██████'s relationship to a psychiatrist named Ikuma, portrayed by Daisuke Ban, who had disappeared after being excommunicated by his colleagues and peers), with designs on destroying her life.
RamRao	training	Ikuma	"Bâsudei" actually has two major climaxes, the theatrical production which spirals out of control when it should've been Sadako's finest hour on stage, and the discovery of where █████ had been hiding the alter ego, the lynch mob, behind an attack on our heroine, coming in contact, face-to-face with a fate worse than death.
RamRao	training	Ikuma	Potent finale, reiterating what I mentioned in the opening sentence of my user comment, as we witness █████'s decision to "end all of it" in regards to Sadako.
RamRao	training	Nolte	All logic is thrown into the wind, and the viewer's intelligence is insulted and pounded upon repeatedly with more force than that baseball bat could ever have generated - the one used by █████ and McGregor.
RamRao	training	Nolte	█████ was molesting corpses decades earlier and the writers of this film would have us believe that this man could years later become the city's chief police investigator!
RamRao	training	Thomas Edison	Making him the killer is as absurd as giving █████████████ credit for inventing the wheel, as laughable as a conspiracy-theory plot from the "X-Files", and as stupid as Kim Basinger's book on how to solve all of world's problems (if she'd ever write one).
RamRao	training	Nolte	This is an essential piece of the puzzle that is badly missing here; McGregor JUST HAPPENS to get a job where he meets █████.
RamRao	training	Nolte	And McGregor's best friend, Brolin, JUST HAPPENS to know a prostitute who is █████'s play toy (and later victim).
RamRao	training	Brolin	And to add some silliness, ██████ is some kind of a deranged thrill-seeker who acts like a total lunatic all the time.
RamRao	training	Brolin	And how the hell did ██████ get into the mortuary when he carried out his "practical joke"?
RamRao	training	Nolte	And how the hell did █████ manage to drag out a body of one of his victims within seconds of McGregor entering the room, without McGregor noticing it (the fact that he had his walkman on and/or was singing and/or talking doesn't make it any more believable)?
RamRao	training	Nolte	And what's with this annoying scene where Arquette JUST HAPPENS to walk into the mortuary at exactly the moment when McGregor is hitting █████ with a baseball bat and predictably starts thinking her boyfriend is the killer??!
RamRao	training	Brolin	More annoyances came from the scene in which ██████'s reaction to McGregor's telling him that the latter is been suspected of murder is to laugh!
RamRao	training	Sadako	It perhaps its not necessarily good as a part of the Ringu series but as a stand alone movie it simply is a really great one.<br /><br />This movie focuses on how ██████ becomes the murdering spirit.
RamRao	training	Sadako	This sort of ruins the image of the evil ██████ spirit we know from the other Ringu movies.
RamRao	training	Hannibal Rising	In that regard this movie suffers from the same problem as "███████████████".
RamRao	training	Sadako	For instance I never saw ██████ as a young adult but more as a 12 year old child or so.
RamRao	training	Carrie	You can see this movie as "Ringu" meets "██████", since this movie story- and character-wise definitely show some similarities to the Brian De Palma horror classic "██████", from 1976.<br /><br />The movie doesn't always have a too fast pace and there is not always a lot happening within the movie.
RamRao	training	Star Search	Many of the others have a certain brainless remedial value to watch while you do the dishes, chat on the internet or sort through your mail.<br /><br />As a serious talent search, however (like ███████████ was), it's absurd!
RamRao	training	Sadako	This sees a lot of the scenes shot inside a theatre, which provides a suitably eerie backdrop for ██████'s doomed quest to lead a normal life and battle the demons of her past that lurk ever closer.<br /><br />With regards to filling in the blanks left open in Ring and Ring 2, this film does very little, for we are already aware that ██████ was pushed to the bottom of the well by her step father, and only hints at the source of the true evil lurking inside her, without giving a clue of its origin or past.
RamRao	training	Seiichi Tanabe	This could, arguably, be a good thing as it still leaves a veil of mystery over the first two films.<br /><br />The actors do a reasonably good job throughout, with a special hats off to ██████████████ who conveyed the confused yet blindly in love hero Tôyama.
RamRao	training	Nakama	██████ brought a certain level of pity to the role of Sadako, a girl seemingly running away from the evil that surrounds and trying to do the right thing.<br /><br />In conclusion Ring O does add depth to the trilogy and deepens rather then clarifies the mystery and in the same way to the recently released Starwars prequels, infuses the film's near one dimensional monster with a sense of depth, which serves to draw pity from it's audience.
RamRao	training	Graham Norton	Ireland may have given the world hurling, green beer, █████████████, and that funny dancing where the arms don't move, but it isn't exactly renowned for its horror movies.
RamRao	training	Paddy Breathnach	Shrooms, a psychological chiller from director ████████████████, is unlikely to change that fact.<br /><br />A dreadful chiller set in the wilds of the 'Emerald Isle', Shrooms sees a group of teens run into a spot of bother when they experiment with hallucinogenic fungi: as they begin to trip out, they begin to check out.
RamRao	training	Breathnach	Or is someone else responsible for their deaths?<br /><br />With nasty desaturated colours, irritating performances from most of the cast (who over-act in a desperate attempt to show the world what they are capable of), frequently fuzzy visuals (used to try and simulate being whacked out of your gourd on drugs), blatant cribs from other horror films (The Blair Witch project and many an Asian ghost film), and virtually no gore or gratuitous nudity, could this mess be any more annoying?<br /><br />Of course it could.<br /><br />Rather than tell a straightforward scary story, ██████████ unwisely chooses to blur the line between what is reality and what is merely a figment of a drug-addled mind.
RamRao	training	Tony Montana	████████████ didn't build his empire after a weekend's charabanging in Aberystwyth.
RamRao	training	Al Pacino	If cocaine is █████████, magic mushrooms would probably be Rhys Ifans.
RamRao	training	Edinburgh	Mushroom munching doesn't generally lead to your boss's wife overdosing spectacularly, FBI helicopters chasing you down the freeway, or free-diving around █████████'s sewage system to an Brian Eno / Daniel Lanois soundtrack; altogether, it's a conspicuously un-cinematic high.
RamRao	training	Camberwell Carrot	Compared with a crimson flower-burst sprouting in a syringe, a cable of coke on a gleaming mirror, or even the mighty █████████████████, how cool is a cup of tea?
RamRao	training	Work	<br /><br />Just a handful of films have nibbled round the caps, including Performance, ████ Is A Four Letter Word and - coyly - Dougal And The Blue Cat (less a whimsical child-friendly distraction, than an escalating series of terrifying derangements), in which Dylan the rabbit complains of feelings of exhaustion after cultivating his "crazy mushrooms".<br /><br />And now Shrooms, the latest addition to this sub-sub genre, in which some American backpackers discover the downside to pigging out on fungi fancies.
RamRao	training	Aspirin	Tara (Haun) doesn't even take ███████ - so perhaps isn't ideally suited to fly to the Old Country on a drugs hunt at the invitation of an Irish school friend-turned-mushroom guru called Jake.
RamRao	training	Huston	<br /><br />Jake (██████, John's grandson, so possibly cast for his distant Celtic roots) turns out to be a supremely punchable Trustafarian tit.
RamRao	training	Joe Strummer	More like ████████████ circa 1977.
RamRao	training	Death Heads	After stringing the kids from the rafters and flinging them to slavering hounds, one vengeful tyke spiked their soup bowls with ███████████ one night and carnage ensued.
RamRao	training	Jake	Nice one, ████: just the thing to tell a bunch of silly kids with a head full of psychedelics.
RamRao	training	Tara	<br /><br />Meanwhile, ████'s witnessing their grisly deaths before they happen - or is she?
RamRao	training	Black Knight	If it's not some malevolent ████████████ or feral dog boy they glimpse tearing through the trees - or do they?
RamRao	training	Weeds	'Sacred █████', a 1998 TV series, encountered similar headaches after getting a bunch of dosed-up students to record their experiences live to digicam.
RamRao	training	Mescalito	Not being Mexican shaman with direct dialling codes to █████████ or the Virgin Mary, these guinea-pigs' trips largely depended on the limits of their experience; they were hardly going to return from their controlled brush with salvia divinorum - containing the most powerful hallucinogen known to man - with anything but giggling fits, some musings on oak bark, and what it's like to sit in a tree.
RamRao	training	Sacred Weeds	But with nothing of note to report, and ████████████' under-cranked and over-cranked cameras affording scant compensation, why bother in the first place?
RamRao	training	Shrooms	<br /><br />███████ also has to make do with the self-same camera tricks to replicate the audio-visual apparitions, and to similarly lackluster effect, while its monotonous over-reliance on sudden, deafening chords pastes over the lack of genuine shocks.
RamRao	training	Bluto	That said, one short scene in which █████ first trips through the woods (in both senses) comes close to capturing the spatial dislocation common to the psychedelic experience, and one wishes the film offered more moments like this one.
RamRao	training	Alan Partridge	But as ██████████████ once opined, "Dere's more to Oireland dan dis."
RamRao	validation	Boyd	The chemistry between ████ and Wolheim worked and the film managed to be quite entertaining.
RamRao	validation	Harold Lloyd	Oddly, however, the film managed to beat out ████████████'s film, SPEEDY, for an Oscar for Best Direction for a Comedy (a category no longer used)--as SPEEDY was a superior film in most ways (it's one of Lloyd's best films).
RamRao	validation	Milestone	Still, it's well worth a look--especially if you love silent films.<br /><br />By the way, director █████████ and Louis Walheim would team up just a few years later for another WWI picture, the great ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT--a film that is definitely NOT a comedy.
RamRao	validation	Miramax	What have ███████ done with the original manuscript.
RamRao	validation	Simon Cowell	Created by ████████████ of American Idol fame, AGT is a talent search show which is similar in format to American Idol and the Gong Show.<br /><br />I don't normally ever watch network TV, and i'm not really big on reality shows at all, but i have been watching this because i thought it would be somewhat interesting.. turns out to be a poorly executed show that'll probably never recover from it's first season without some major changes (although it has already been renewed for a second season in '07).<br /><br />Basically it's a talent show where people from all across the u.s. audition with a unique talent.. everything from 9 year old singers to electric violinists, magic acts to rock bands, comedians to jugglers and ventriloquists, they're all here.
RamRao	validation	Mr. Koji	Since this movie is an adaptation of ████████ Suzuki's Lemonheart which is among the 3 stories contained in Ringu 0: Baasudei that was released in 1999, it's sufficient say that the director did pretty well with altering some of its contents to suit the interpretation of the previous movies (Ringu and Ringu 2) which was also unparalleled.
RamRao	validation	Sadako	I don't think the storyline was confusing at all since it mostly concentrated on ██████'s life (Derived from Lemonheart) and doesn't really focus on the curse of the video tape.
RamRao	validation	Sadako	Since I took the time to search for an informative website that clarified some of the scenes from the movie, I've accrued better understanding of the story and respect for it.<br /><br />What I truly love about this movie is the fact that they wanted us to feel sympathetic towards ██████'s character albeit the wickedness of what we see in Ringu and Ringu 2.
RamRao	validation	Yukie Nakama	Bravo to ████████████ for portraying Sadako's character effectively.
RamRao	validation	Sadako	It's designed to tell us the tragic story of ██████'s life before the cursed video tape, which exceeded from my own expectations.
RamRao	validation	Nakata Hideo	It's dramatic atmosphere haunted me and made me justify why such a character would turn out to be malevolent in Ringu.<br /><br />I can see why many are baffled by the story since the one who directed this is not ████████████ and obviously lingered a bit from the previous adaptations (I guess you might say more on the book than Ringu and Ringu 2.
RamRao	validation	Katharine	He meets a female fighter, █████████, who appears to be homeless but who can fight and defeat men twice her size.
RamRao	validation	Dublin	The two eventually team up, but ██████'s somewhat sleazy past catches up with them, causing conflict, pain, and emotional distress for both.<br /><br />I enjoy all types of fighting (the real kind) and consequently, I find myself being somewhat critical of film fight scenes, particularly when they involve obvious mismatches.
RamRao	validation	Nick Nolte	I won't go into details, but realize that it's set in a morgue (just go with that image for a second), involves really icky mental disorders, hookers, bored twenty-somethings and a serial killer.<br /><br />Perhaps ██████████'s worst role EVER.
RamRao	validation	Josh Brolin	Ewan McGregor just looks embarrassed, as do ███████████ and Patricia Arquette.
RamRao	validation	Rasen	I liked Ringu 0 better than █████, it explained more about Sadako's history.
RamRao	validation	Sadako	The actress who played ██████ was, what seemed to me, the only person that could play her.
RamRao	validation	Tartan Asia	It doesn't compare to the movies brought out by ███████████ Exteme.
RamRao	validation	Phone	Such as Tale of Two Sisters, █████, (Memento Mori, Whispering Corridors, Wishing Stairs) a trilogy, Premonition, H, Oldboy, and many others.
RamRao	validation	Ringu	If you enjoyed watching Rasen, █████ 0, █████, and █████ 2, you'll love the Tartan Asia Extreme movies.
RamRao	validation	William	███████ Boyd and Louis Wolheim are the "Two Arabian Knights" referred to in the title, humorously.
RamRao	validation	Arabia	Eventually, they find themselves on board a ship bound for ██████.
RamRao	validation	Arab	While tripping out to the Middle East, they rescue an ████ woman, Mary Astor, who turns out to be a Princess; and, of course, becomes a romantic interest for the "Two ████ian Knights".
RamRao	validation	Lewis Milestone	No points for guessing who wins the veiled Ms. Astor!<br /><br />The film is very well photographed and directed; ███████████████ has wonderful sets, and stages scenes beautifully.
RamRao	validation	Mr. Wolheim	Of the performances, ███████████ stands out - he creates a character so understandable you can almost hear him speak, trough the film is silent.
RamRao	validation	Boris Karloff	█████████████ appears as the "Purser"; watch for his big scene on ship, when Wolheim goes into a room with him for some money (what actually happens is a mystery).
RamRao	validation	Director Milestone	██████████████████ uses parades of soldiers moving to great effect; this "shower" scene is different in that several of the men don't look as Caucasian as you might expect - maybe not as many Caucasian men would agree to appear nude?
RamRao	validation	Simon	█████ Cowell manages to try another spin-off of "American Idol", despite of the failure with his previous attempt "American Inventor".<br /><br />It follows the same guidelines than "American Idol", you know, a host the three stereotypical judges, an obedient crowd for audience, and some entertaining contestants plus many more that are shown only for their humiliation on national TV, that is actually what most of the public seems to dig anyway.
RamRao	validation	Cowell	Even more, giving it is an open talent contest, half of them are singers what gives ██████ a chance for a shot closer to the "Idol" success.<br /><br />Regis Philbin does his job, he always manages to look as a nice guy, I don't think he contributes rising the show interest but is not responsible for the poor overcome either.<br /><br />Moving on.
RamRao	validation	David Hasselhoff	Let's see.<br /><br />Let me start by ████████████████ just because he is the only I know.
RamRao	testing	Brandy	And it guarantees the show will be sold in Germany too.<br /><br />Piers Morgan, who I don't have any clue who he is, takes the role of the wise and balanced judge completing his stereotype with a British accent that in America seems -wrongfully- to be synonymous of a higher intellect.<br /><br />Finally ██████.
RamRao	testing	Simon	If █████ were in this show not even the contestants would be necessary to nail its success.
RamRao	testing	Young Sadako	████████████ is part of a theater troupe, and a reporter knows who she is but the rest of the cast doesn't, at least, not yet.
RamRao	testing	Sadako	There are glimpses of ██████'s strange powers, which she can't seem to control when she's threatened.
RamRao	testing	Sadako	██████ then ends up with the leading role in the play but when the meddling reporter slips a tape in that isn't meant to be part of the play, it changes everything and ██████'s telekinetic powers are unleashed on the unsuspecting audience and cast, but stopped just short of harm to anyone....except, herself.
RamRao	testing	Ringu	!<br /><br />If you enjoy true atmosphere in films, that creeping feeling of dread usually reserved for coming face to face with your own personal phobia, then watch this and prepare yourself- the final 15 minutes may well be the most heart-stoppingly chilling 15 minutes you will ever witness.<br /><br />Just a warning though; it is slow paced, even more so than █████, a complaint many people seem to have with these movies, and the first time i watched it i wasn't sure if it was leading anywhere.
RamRao	testing	Sadako	██████ Yamamura is part of an acting school, and her first role is a few days away.
RamRao	testing	Sadako	The story also follows a journalist who has traced down ██████, she is the widow of a man who died, also under mysterious circumstances at the hands of, she believes, ██████'s estranged mother.
RamRao	testing	Sadako	██████'s mother was famed for her supposed supernatural abilities, and killed herself a short while ago.
RamRao	testing	Sadako	The journalist wants to find out the truth, and finds ██████ just before opening night.
